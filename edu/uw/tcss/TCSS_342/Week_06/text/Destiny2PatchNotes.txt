Crucible
Trials of Osiris

Rewards
Added new rewards, including an armor set, Ghost Shell, ship, Sparrow, and emblem.
No longer requires Flawless to earn most rewards.
Moved Trials away from a Flawless-based system to a "get seven wins on a card" system that rewards win streaks, with multiple tiers and exclusive aesthetic rewards for higher win streaks.
Improved the base reward structure of Trials.
Pinnacle Challenges now award Trials armor in addition to the Pinnacle gear.
Increased the amount of reputation gained on losses by 10x and added a new bonus that is earned by playing in a fireteam with clanmates.
Added a new set of base rewards for wins and losses that will be added to the existing Trios completion rewards, but for players in any fireteam configuration.
Passages - To help simplify the process, we have reduced the number of passages available to players from Saint-14 to two, one for each initial experience.
Lighthouse Passage
All you need to do is win seven games on a Lighthouse Passage and you will earn entrance to the Lighthouse, regardless of how many losses are on the card.
The Lighthouse Chest rewards are now broken up into two types:
Repeatable rewards that you can earn every time you complete a Lighthouse Passage and open the chest.
Weekly win streak rewards (from one to seven wins in a row), which can be earned once per week and must be true win streaks; there are no mercies here.
Trials Passage
We want to provide a separate place in Trials that is more like Iron Banner in terms of rewards and matchmaking to get additional players into the ecosystem.
Utilizes Weekly Performance-Based Matchmaking if everyone in your fireteam is on a Completed Lighthouse, Flawless, or Trials Passage.
Trials of Osiris Passage provides a healthy reputation bonus of 75 - 150 per win, depending on your current rank with Saint-14.
Skill

Changed how skill is tracked and updated for all modes.
Objectives are now on par with base kills for points.
Additional points are granted for kills that are in service to the objective.
Removed multiple "farmable" points like damage dealt, revives, and longest kill streak.
Player Score Stat and Post Game Scoreboards

A new stat called Player Score is displayed on our post-game scoreboards, which is a direct reflection of how many points you earned towards updating your skill rating in a game.
The post-game scoreboards of all modes now show Opponents Defeated and Combat Efficiency.
Added additional stats to the scoreboards of more modes, including Longest Chain (highest multi-kill medal) and Longest Streak.

Zone Control

Wins and losses - Add or remove a base value of 100 points.
Performance bonus - Linked to Player Score and Efficiency, rewards between -10 and +10 points.
Contribution scalar - This system can grant a bonus of up to +50 to either reduce the points lost on defeat or grant additional points for a win, and will be utilized in two circumstances:
First, to help offset occurrences where some players contributed significantly more to the outcome of the game than others.
Second, it can also be applied as quitter compensation when a player has left earlier in the match, but the remaining players continue to finish it out.
Skill Modifier - Based on the opposing team's average skill compared to your team's average skill. Capped at -20 to +20.

The Queenbreaker
Can now swap between its two scopes using special reload that also alters the weapon's firing behavior:

Abilities
All Subclasses

All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.
Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.
This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.

Touch of Thunder
Lightning Grenade:

Increased tracking travel speed when targeting PvE combatants by between 0.5 and 1 meters per second, increasing with the storm's lifetime.

Lightweight Knife
Now has 2 melee charges by default.
Increased throw animation speed by 33%.
Reduced suppression time between throws, so both knives can be thrown very quickly back-to-back.
The additional melee charge does not stack with Ophidia Spathe, due to the Exotic's unique energy recharge behavior. We'll be monitoring this and evaluating how things are playing once things go live.
Knock 'Em Down
Reduced internal cooldown on throwing knife refund from 1 second to 0.2 seconds.
Gunpowder Gamble
Fixed an issue where Gunpowder Gamble was unable to damage Strand Tangles.

If the projectile detonates after the first 0.7 seconds of its lifetime, it now creates 6 shrapnel, up from 5.
When Sol Invictus is equipped, only 3 shrapnel submunitions are created, regardless of flight time.
Shrapnel submunitions now deal additional damage when Sol Invictus is not equipped, with the damage increasing after the first 0.7 seconds of the projectile's lifetime.
Dawnblade

Armor of Light now instead grants additional damage resistance to players inside the Ward of Dawn:30% vs. enemy players and 60% vs. enemy combatants.
Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn dome remains roughly the same as it was before vs. PvE combatants.
Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn is significantly lower than it was before vs.other players in PvP, and cannot be further increased by stacking Bastion Barricades inside the Ward to gain additional Overshield layers.
No longer provides Weapons of Light by default. This behavior has been moved to the benefits of Helm of Saint-14.
Allies near the Ward of Dawn dome now have Void Overshield trickled on over time, similar to the volume behind a Bastion barricade.
This trickle rate is reduced in PvP activities.
The Ward of Dawn caster can now generate additional Orbs of Power by defeating enemies with melee attacks in or near their Ward of Dawn dome. Up to a maximum of 5.

Voidwall Grenade
Fixed an issue where the central damage volume was offset significantly lower than the left and right volumes.
Void Fragments
Echo of Instability
Can now be activated by defeating targets with Forerunner's The Rock grenade.

Silence & Squall
Increased Squall maximum travel speed by 10%.

Tectonic Harvest
Added new behavior:
While Tectonic Harvest is equipped, Stasis Shards grant a small amount of health and a stack of Frost Armor.
Now creates a Stasis Shard when shattering a frozen target in addition to shattering Stasis crystals.

Threadrunner
Ensnaring Slam
Detonation volume vs. enemy players is now a cylinder with a 6.5-meter radius, rather than a sphere with an 8-meter radius.
This results in fewer instances of victims correctly attempting to counterplay by jumping but being caught by the Ensnaring Slam detonation high up in the air.
Threaded Specter
Arming shape vs. PvE combatants now grows more quickly, resulting in more responsive detonations when used in close quarters.
Threaded Spike

About every 0.9 seconds, an additional stack of Frost Armor is granted, resetting the timer.
Triton Vice
Glaive projectile final blows now always trigger a detonation that matches the Glaive's damage type, even when the Glaive does not match the equipped subclass.
The surrounded effect provided by Triton Vice while wielding a Glaive now lingers on the player for five seconds after no longer being surrounded.

Mask of Bakris
Now requires a Stasis Super to be equipped, instead of a Stasis subclass.

Exotic Primary Weapons and Trace Rifles benefit from the below damage buffs versus Minor combatants.
Increased base PvE damage versus all combatants.

Exceptions: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike's storm. (These are both performing well.)

Wave Grenade Launchers
The size of the wave is now affected by the blast radius stat. This will mostly impact the width of the wave, though the length and height will also be scaled.
The default display stat for the blast radius has been changed from 100 to 50 (where 50 represents the previous baseline—any stat over 50 will result in a larger wave segment than what was possible before).
Special ammo Wave - Frame Grenade Launchers overperform as add clear weapons in their current state, so we've pulled the length of the wave back a little.
Reduced the length of the waves from 22 meters to 15 meters (except for Dead Messenger).
Swords
Updated the Sword reticle to better indicate its charge state. When Sword energy is consumed, the amount of delay the Sword has before it begins to recharge now subtly appears in the reticle.

Breaking a matched shield or piercing a Champion's Barrier will cause the target to ignite.
Devil's Ruin
Fixed an issue where the firing animation from Devil's Ruin would get applied to other equipped Sidearms if the weapon was swapped during the firing animation.
Gjallarhorn
Updated the visuals of Wolfpack Rounds to match the damage type of the weapon. For example:
On Gjallarhorn, they will use Solar effects.
On the Royal Entry Void Rocket Launcher buffed by Gjallarhorn, they will have Void effects.
Grand Overture
Grand Overture now displays 'Volley Ready' instead of 'Rockets Loaded' after special reload, to help better indicate when the rockets are primed to fire on trigger pull.
Osteo Striga
Now has a 4-second cooldown on the poison burst on kills. (Poison burst from sustained damage doesn't receive this cooldown.)
The Lament
Reduced healing effect by 20%.
While this weapon does inherit the 7% global buff to Swords, we've reduced the damage of the high end of the chained heavy attack by 20% from that point.
This means combos at lower stacks are less affected by the change than combos at higher stacks.
Deterministic Chaos
This weapon is now intrinsically anti-barrier.
The Heavy Metal and Vexadecimal perks have had their locations and behavior swapped.
Heavy Metal now causes every 4th bullet to make targets volatile.

Instances of Underdog have been replaced with Pulse Monitor.
Osmosis and Permeability:
These no longer drop off when pulling out a Ghost or similar actions.
Now partially refill the weapon's magazine on activation.
Chill Clip
Adjusted the number of slow stacks applied based on properties of the weapon.
In this case, Rapid-Fire Fusions like Riptide will still require 3 shots to freeze, but slower firing Fusions only require 2.
All other archetypes have been un-nerfed and only require 2 shots to freeze.
Killing Tally
The Killing Tally perk on the original 21% Delirium Machine Gun has been updated to match the version found on random-rolled weapons.

Fixed an issue where the melee buff visual effect repeatedly flashed when Pugilist was activated by melee damage-over-time.
Dream Work
Updated to work with additional weapon archetypes.

This can be tracked via new Triumphs in each raid's respective collection.
Memento stack size limit has been increased from 1 to 3.
Mementos are no longer tracked in the Inventory tab.
Players can now view, track, and apply their collected Mementos within the inspection screen of an enhanced or shaped weapon.
Dismantling Faded Mementos will provide +1 Memento to use within the inspection screen.
If a player is at the new stack size limited of 3 Mementos, that Memento will not drop again until they are holding less than 3 Mementos.
Fixed an issue where Raid Adept Weapons from The Pantheon Triumphs dropped without selected perks. Players will now see these perks applied on those items.
At a later date, a fix will be applied to correct bad masterwork or enhanced intrinsic options on these weapons to the intended roll.
We recommend players select a Masterwork option that functions on that weapon type to get the stat benefit when upgrading to enhanced.
Removed Resonant and Harmonic Alloys.

Gameplay and Investment
Abilities
All Subclasses

All Super abilities now use the same damage-based recharge parameters.
Previously, energy gained through damage dealt and received was scaled based on the passive recharge rate of the Super, resulting in a broader delta between long-recharge Supers and short-recharge Supers than intended.
This will, for example, bring the real-world uptime of Ward of Dawn and Well of Radiance closer to the uptime of a Super like Arc Staff or Fists of Havoc.
Arc Subclasses

Arcstrider
Arc Staff:
Heavy palm strike attacks and heavy air slam blind enemies.

Gunslinger
Lightweight Knife
Now has 2 melee charges by default.
Increased throw animation speed by 33%.
Reduced suppression time between throws, so both knives can be thrown very quickly back-to-back.
The additional melee charge does not stack with Ophidia Spathe, due to the Exotic's unique energy recharge behavior. We'll be monitoring this and evaluating how things are playing once things go live.
Knock 'Em Down
Reduced internal cooldown on throwing knife refund from 1 second to 0.2 seconds.
Gunpowder Gamble
Fixed an issue where Gunpowder Gamble was unable to damage Strand Tangles.

If the projectile detonates within the first 0.7 seconds of its lifetime, it now creates 4 shrapnel submunitions, up from 3.
If the projectile detonates after the first 0.7 seconds of its lifetime, it now creates 6 shrapnel, up from 5.
When Sol Invictus is equipped, only 3 shrapnel submunitions are created, regardless of flight time.
Shrapnel submunitions now deal additional damage when Sol Invictus is not equipped, with the damage increasing after the first 0.7 seconds of the projectile's lifetime.

Sentinel
Shield Throw:
Increased maximum bounce count from 4 to 5.
Increased maximum lifetime from 3 seconds to 4 seconds.

Armor of Light now instead grants additional damage resistance to players inside the Ward of Dawn:30% vs. enemy players and 60% vs. enemy combatants.
Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn dome remains roughly the same as it was before vs. PvE combatants.
Effective health of players inside the Ward of Dawn is significantly lower than it was before vs.other players in PvP, and cannot be further increased by stacking Bastion Barricades inside the Ward to gain additional Overshield layers.
No longer provides Weapons of Light by default. This behavior has been moved to the benefits of Helm of Saint-14.
Allies near the Ward of Dawn dome now have Void Overshield trickled on over time, similar to the volume behind a Bastion barricade.
This trickle rate is reduced in PvP activities.
The Ward of Dawn caster can now generate additional Orbs of Power by defeating enemies with melee attacks in or near their Ward of Dawn dome. Up to a maximum of 5.

Voidwall Grenade
Fixed an issue where the central damage volume was offset significantly lower than the left and right volumes.
Void Fragments
Echo of Instability
Can now be activated by defeating targets with Forerunner's The Rock grenade.

Behemoth
Tectonic Harvest
Added new behavior:
While Tectonic Harvest is equipped, Stasis Shards grant a small amount of health and a stack of Frost Armor.
Now creates a Stasis Shard when shattering a frozen target in addition to shattering Stasis crystals.

Threadrunner
Ensnaring Slam
Detonation volume vs. enemy players is now a cylinder with a 6.5-meter radius, rather than a sphere with an 8-meter radius.
This results in fewer instances of victims correctly attempting to counterplay by jumping but being caught by the Ensnaring Slam detonation high up in the air.
Threaded Specter
Arming shape vs. PvE combatants now grows more quickly, resulting in more responsive detonations when used in close quarters.
Threaded Spike

Exotic Primary Weapons and Trace Rifles benefit from the below damage buffs versus Minor combatants.
Increased base PvE damage versus all combatants.

Exceptions: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike's storm. (These are both performing well.)

Wave Grenade Launchers
The size of the wave is now affected by the blast radius stat. This will mostly impact the width of the wave, though the length and height will also be scaled.
The default display stat for the blast radius has been changed from 100 to 50 (where 50 represents the previous baseline—any stat over 50 will result in a larger wave segment than what was possible before).
Special ammo Wave - Frame Grenade Launchers overperform as add clear weapons in their current state, so we've pulled the length of the wave back a little.
Reduced the length of the waves from 22 meters to 15 meters (except for Dead Messenger).
Swords
Updated the Sword reticle to better indicate its charge state. When Sword energy is consumed, the amount of delay the Sword has before it begins to recharge now subtly appears in the reticle.
Fixed an issue where the Overwhelming Battlesong debuff from some missions would prevent Swords from recharging or losing energy while guarding.
Fixed an issue where unpowered caster Sword heavy attacks would not reset the Sword's energy recharge delay.
Fixed an issue where uncharged adaptive Sword heavy attacks cost the same amount of ammo as their charged counterparts. They now cost 1 ammo, same as other uncharged heavy attacks.
Rocket Sidearms
Added a slight delay to the detonation to allow perks to activate correctly if they required precision kills.
Exotics
Non-precision based add clear-Exotic Primary weapons:
Reduced splash damage by 10% on the following weapons:
Sunshot
Trinity Ghoul
Polaris Lance
Graviton Lance
Rat King
Swapped the firing animation to the same one used by other auto-fire Sidearms.
Dead Man's Tale
Baseline:

Increased reload speed benefit of Cranial Spike stacks.
With catalyst, when hip-firing:
Slightly reduced accuracy benefits.
Increased magnetism falloff scale (1.6 to 1.7).
Increased baseline rate of fire from 130RPM to 140RPM.
Removed PvE-only damage buff that scaled with stacks of Cranial Spike and added a 15% damage bonus at maximum stacks of Cranial Spike.
Colony
Now spawns additional insectoid robots on final blows. More robots (up to five) spawn from tougher combatants.
Touch of Malice
Increased duration of burn applied by the Darkness Ball against combatants from 2 to 3.5 seconds.
Necrochasm
Intrinsic perk now provides increased reload speed after precision kills.
Increased duration of burn applied by the Cursed Thrall explosion against combatants from 2 to 3.5 seconds.
Catalyst has been rebuilt.
One for Thrall: Damaging 3 combatants in quick succession provides a period of increased damage, range, and aim assist.
Truth
Increased area-of-effect (AoE) damage such that it doesn't lose noticeable damage due to not dealing impact damage.
Increased total reserves by 3. (This is on top of the reserves change to high impact Rocket Launchers from the 7.3.5 update.)
Queenbreaker
Increased damage versus bosses, minibosses, Champions, and vehicles by 12%.
Increased reserve ammunition by 3.
Symmetry
Catalyst now provides +10 reload speed, +10 handling, and the Eddy Current perk, in addition to its existing effects.

Bastion
Reworked Saint's Fists perk: Dealing damage with melee increases the charge rate, damage, and reload speed for a short duration. Landing a majority of pellets in a burst increases melee damage.
Eriana's Vow
Breaking a matched shield or piercing a Champion's Barrier will cause the target to ignite.
Devil's Ruin
Fixed an issue where the firing animation from Devil's Ruin would get applied to other equipped Sidearms if the weapon was swapped during the firing animation.
Gjallarhorn
Updated the visuals of Wolfpack Rounds to match the damage type of the weapon. For example:
On Gjallarhorn, they will use Solar effects.
On the Royal Entry Void Rocket Launcher buffed by Gjallarhorn, they will have Void effects.
Grand Overture
Grand Overture now displays 'Volley Ready' instead of 'Rockets Loaded' after special reload, to help better indicate when the rockets are primed to fire on trigger pull.
Osteo Striga
Now has a 4-second cooldown on the poison burst on kills. (Poison burst from sustained damage doesn't receive this cooldown.)
The Lament
Reduced healing effect by 20%.
While this weapon does inherit the 7% global buff to Swords, we've reduced the damage of the high end of the chained heavy attack by 20% from that point.
This means combos at lower stacks are less affected by the change than combos at higher stacks.
Deterministic Chaos
This weapon is now intrinsically anti-barrier.
The Heavy Metal and Vexadecimal perks have had their locations and behavior swapped.
Heavy Metal now causes every 4th bullet to make targets volatile.
Vexadecimal now causes every 16th bullet to also weaken targets.
Divinity
Increased the number of shots required to generate the cage by 75% against combatants (PvP unchanged).

Branched between Heavy and Special ammo weapons.
Special: About 15% smaller AoE size and 20% less damage.
Heavy: Same AoE as before and 30% more damage.
Eddy Current
Now takes 1.5 seconds of sprinting to activate instead of 3 seconds.
Also provides a bonus to handling and a 5% scalar on each stat at base.
Being amplified will immediately activate the perk at its maximum effectiveness.
Underdog
Instances of Underdog have been replaced with Pulse Monitor.
Osmosis and Permeability:
These no longer drop off when pulling out a Ghost or similar actions.
Now partially refill the weapon's magazine on activation.
Chill Clip
Adjusted the number of slow stacks applied based on properties of the weapon.
In this case, Rapid-Fire Fusions like Riptide will still require 3 shots to freeze, but slower firing Fusions only require 2.
All other archetypes have been un-nerfed and only require 2 shots to freeze.
Killing Tally
The Killing Tally perk on the original 21% Delirium Machine Gun has been updated to match the version found on random-rolled weapons.
High Ground
Reworked to provide a stacking damage bonus when getting kills in any context (like Rampage) or instantly granting the maximum amount of stacks when damaging an enemy from the high ground.
PvE max bonus increased to a 25% damage bonus, and PvP max increased to 15%.
Perks that currently match the player's equipped subclass have been changed as follows:
Osmosis and Tessellation now match the damage type of the equipped grenade.
Permeability and Elemental Capacitor now match the damage type of the equipped Super.
Deconstruct
Now refills from reserves instead of from thin air and should trigger more reliably across weapon types.
Headstone
Fixed an issue where Headstone used a Stasis positive buff icon for its cooldown status message. Headstone now uses a cooldown icon, similar to other cooldowns.

Fixed an issue where the melee buff visual effect repeatedly flashed when Pugilist was activated by melee damage-over-time.
Dream Work
Updated to work with additional weapon archetypes.
Precision Instrument

Updated new drops of Raid Adepts from Crota's End and Root of Nightmares to have 2 traits in their trait columns.
Added Weapon Enhancement to the Raid Adepts from Vow of Disciple and King's Fall.
Collecting base weapon patterns will now provide a boost per weapon set to the chance of getting a third trait in the trait columns on new drops.
This can be tracked via new Triumphs in each raid's respective collection.
Memento stack size limit has been increased from 1 to 3.
Mementos are no longer tracked in the Inventory tab.
Players can now view, track, and apply their collected Mementos within the inspection screen of an enhanced or shaped weapon.
Dismantling Faded Mementos will provide +1 Memento to use within the inspection screen.
If a player is at the new stack size limited of 3 Mementos, that Memento will not drop again until they are holding less than 3 Mementos.
Fixed an issue where Raid Adept Weapons from The Pantheon Triumphs dropped without selected perks. Players will now see these perks applied on those items.
At a later date, a fix will be applied to correct bad masterwork or enhanced intrinsic options on these weapons to the intended roll.
We recommend players select a Masterwork option that functions on that weapon type to get the stat benefit when upgrading to enhanced.
Removed Resonant and Harmonic Alloys.
Acquiring an Adept version of a weapon now unlocks Focusing for base version of that weapon.
Fixed an issue where anti-Champion mods were causing other weapon perks to fall off.

Abilities

This affects the following melee abilities:
Grapple Melee

All non-Super abilities
Neutral game abilities now receive variable amounts of ability energy from perks that grant instant percentage chunk energy, based on the ability's passive cooldown tier.
The shortest cooldown abilities will receive the same percentage of energy as they did previously, but as passive cooldown increases, the energy granted from perks scales per tier, down to a floor of 50% for grenades and class abilities and 60% for melee abilities. This means that the number of seconds of raw cooldown reduction granted from chunk energy perks is more closely equivalent across all ability cooldown tiers.
For example, with Firebolt Grenade (which have a 64-second base cooldown time) vs. Lightning Grenade (which have a 152-second base cooldown time):
With the previous system, a 10% base energy chunk reduced the cooldown of Firebolt Grenade by 6.4 seconds and reduced the cooldown of Lightning Grenade by 15.2 seconds.
With the new system, a 10% base energy chunk reduces the cooldown of Firebolt Grenade by 6.4 seconds and reduces the cooldown of Lightning Grenade by 7.6 seconds.
Note: Perks that were designed to grant full energy refunds (e.g., Knock 'Em Down) or perks that target a single, specific ability (e.g., Shinobu's Vow) are not affected and grant the same energy that they did in the previous system.

Decreased the airborne pellet spread penalty for Pellet Shotguns by 20%.
Checkmate Weapon Tuning
Pulse Rifles
Decreased bonus damage very slightly to decrease some resiliency forgiveness (critical to body shot ratio) thresholds by 1 tier.
This does not shift optimal time-to-kill against base resilience for any Pulse Rifles.
Hand Cannons
Increased bonus damage slightly to remove the resiliency threshold that shifts optimal time-to-kill for Adaptive (140 RPM) Hand Cannons.
Adaptive HCs will again kill all resilience levels with 3 critical hits.
However, they will lose the ability to kill with 3 shots sooner into damage falloff than in standard Crucible.
How quickly that happens will still depend on the resilience of the opponent.

All classes
Fragments
Thread of Generation
Reduced the overall energy gain per damage event against PvE enemies by ~20%.
Rebalanced the energy gain multiplier across Primary weapon archetypes to bring energy gains for dealing damage with precision weapons and fully automatic weapons closer together.
Note: This means that, overall, while fully automatic Primary weapons have had their efficiency reduced, precision Primary weapons have had their efficiency increased to compensate.
Thread of Mind
Reduced class energy gain based on the tier of the defeated target:
Minor combatants reduced from 15% to 10%.
Major combatants and players reduced from 25% to 15%.

Minor combatants: 1.
Elite combatants or players: 2.

Armor
The functionality of the Foetracer hunter Exotic helmet has been moved to the Knucklehead Radar Exotic helmet.
Foetracer's previous perk has been completely replaced by the following perk: Damaging a powerful combatant or Guardian with an ability grants you a temporary bonus to weapon damage matching your subclass type. Defeating that target with a weapon matching the damage type of your subclass creates an elemental pickup.
The Lucky Raspberry Exotic armor has been reworked and now reads: Increases the chaining capabilities of Arc Bolt Grenade. Damaging enemies with jolt lightning strikes and collecting Ionic Traces grant additional Arc Bolt Grenade energy. Arc Bolt Grenades stun Overload Champions and delay their health regeneration.
Reverted the previous change to the cooldown of Duskfield grenades granted by Renewal Grasps.
Reworked ACD/0 Feedback Fence to make use of the Armor Charge system. New perk: Melee hits grant Armor Charge, and you take reduced melee damage while you have Armor Charge. Taking melee damage causes you to emit a burst of damaging Arc energy that jolts targets, consuming your Armor Charge and dealing more damage based on the number of stacks consumed.
In addition to its existing functionality, Icefall Mantle now has a chance to grant an escalating bonus to Stasis weapon damage on Stasis kills. Activating your class ability grants you the highest tier damage bonus.
The Hallowfire Heart Exotic has had its perk reworked: While standing in a Sunspot, defeating an enemy with Solar damage creates a Sunspot. It greatly improves recharge rate of your abilities while your Super is charged and provides a small benefit to the airborne effectiveness stat of all weapons.
Design note: Hallowfire Heart had too much overlap with Heart of Inmost Light and yet was restricted to one damage type. With this rework, we are looking to lean harder into the Solar subclass by letting you create more frequent Sunspots, while still retaining some elements of its previous functionality.
The tier-4 Arc weapon damage bonus granted by your Fist of Havoc Super ending has had its duration extended to 30 seconds, up from 10.
Path of the Burning Steps now grants the tier-4 Solar weapon damage bonus on Solar grenade kills.
In addition to its existing functionality, Doom Fang Pauldrons now have a chance to grant an escalating bonus to Void weapon damage on Void kills. Void melee kills automatically grant the highest tier damage bonus.
When you use Blink, Astrocyte Verse now causes enemies near you to become volatile. When using the Nova Warp Super, your Dark Blink movement ability does not cost Super energy.
In addition to its existing functionality, Geomag Stabilizers now grants energy for your Chaos Reach super when picking up an Ionic Trace.
In addition to its existing functionality, Wings of Sacred Dawn now reloads your Solar weapons from reserves when you get a kill while suspended in midair.
Winter's Guile now causes enemies encased by the Penumbral Blast melee to automatically shatter.
Arbor Warden's unique class ability should now benefit from all sources of bonus class ability energy correctly.
Fixed an issue that would cause Arbor Warden's class ability to not animate properly when used with Jotunn or Tractor Cannon.
Fixed an issue where Eternal Warrior's Arc Weapon damage bonus wouldn't function unless you had the super Fist of Havoc equipped.
Fixed an issue causing Chromatic Fire's elemental explosions to fail to apply their status effects in certain situations.
Fixed an issue causing Liar's Handshake's bonus melee damage to not function correctly with the Lethal Current Arc Aspect or the Gathering Storm Arc Super.
Fixed an issue where Swarmers would not create Threadlings when a Tangle was thrown after grappling to a different Tangle.
Threadlings spawned via Swarmers now work properly when The Wanderer Aspect is equipped.
Fixed an issue where Peregrine Greaves' HUD status effect didn't have an icon.
The Armor Charge HUD element will now show your actual maximum number of potential Armor Charges, rather than always showing 6 empty boxes.
Fixed an issue causing Swords to not benefit from Ammo Reserves armor mods.
Fixed an issue causing the Hunter’s Golden Gun Super to benefit from Kinetic Surge armor mods.
Fixed an issue where the Season 20 Guardian Games class items were not available as armor ornaments.
Added unkindled versions of both the Candescent and Sunlit universal ornaments for all classes.
For Guardians that unlocked the armor glows for these sets during Solstice, both versions will be available to unlock in the Appearance screen.
Guardians that have not unlocked the glows will not see any changes to these sets in their available ornaments.
The Warlock armor Psionic Speaker Robes, Resolute Champion Robes, and Wraps of the Emperor's Minister have had their visual issues fixed.
Fixed an issue that caused the Hunter chest armor Vest of the Taken King to be invisible when worn in the H.E.L.M.
Weapons
Global
PvE kills with two Special weapons equipped now generate Heavy ammo at the same rate as two Primaries or one Primary and one Special.
Decoupled damage falloff from zoom.
Added a fixed ADS Damage Falloff Scalar to all guns with damage falloff (see Dev Insights: Season 22 Weapons Preview for details).
Reticles
Replaced the perk active hipfire reticle element. The new one should work better at different field-of-view (FOV) settings.
Added a perk active indicator to Symmetry.
Moved Grand Overture's charge meter further down the screen to reduce instances of overlapping other reticle elements.
Weapon Archetypes
Hand Cannons
Increased reload speed at 0 stat by 15%.
Increased damage against minor combatants (red bars) by 20%.
Increased damage against major combatants (orange bars) by 75%.
Changed Warden's Law to be the first member of a new sub-family, Heavy Burst.
Fires a 2-round burst.
Bows
Reduced minimum reload animation duration from 0.5 seconds to 0.3 seconds. (This means that applying reload speed scalars on top of high reload stat will still have an effect.)
Increased the projectile velocity at full draw so that the projectiles will continue to perform as if they were hit scan at longer distances at higher framerates.
Equalized the full draw projectile velocity with Combat Bows.
Fixed the RPM stat of Aggressive Submachine Guns to correctly show 720 RPM.
Reduced Aggressive Sidearms base damage from 32 to 30.
Increased BxR Battler Pulse Rifle’s zoom back to 20.
Fixed the impact stat on The Comedian Shotgun. This is cosmetic only, damage per pellet is unchanged.
Fixed an issue where the Adept Masterworks and Enhanced Intrinsic perks for Fusion Rifles were decreasing the damage dealt by fusions when they changed the Charge Time stat.
Wave Frame Heavy Grenade Launchers
Reduced the size and damage of the self-damage AOE.
This should make it much safer to fire the projectile closer to your feet.
Swords
Sword guard has been reworked. Energy now recharges after a short delay when used but recharges much faster.
The delay before recharge and recharge rate are both governed by the guard charge rate stat.
This delay ranges between 2.7 seconds and 1.05 seconds, depending on charge rate.
The rate energy returns after the delay has massively increased to compensate, increasing even more at higher charge rate. Even after the delay, Swords now return to full energy from empty faster than before this rework.
Full-power heavy attacks can now be used with any non-zero amount of Sword energy, rather than requiring full sword energy.
Sword guard damage resistance has been massively increased and now provides between 82.5% and 95% damage reduction depending on guard resistance stat.
This damage resistance value is sharply reduced against other players, similar to glaives, providing between 52.5% and 65% damage reduction depending on guard resistance stat.
Sword guard no longer loses energy when taking damage.
As a result of the above, guard efficiency has been removed as a stat.
Sword guard duration increased across every guard type, with those with shortest durations benefiting most.
Sword guard talent nodes have had their stats squished down.
Combined with the above, even though their stats have been reduced, their damage reduction, charge rates, and guard durations have increased across the board.
This allows origin traits and other Sword perks more room to increase these stats and allow performance beyond their previous maximum.
Sword guard talent nodes now visually affect the Charge Rate bar on the inspection screen when hovered or selected, similar to other stat-affecting nodes.
Sword movement speed while blocking increased from a 0.75x multiplier to 0.85x multiplier.
The Lament Exotic Sword has been special-cased so its charge rate and delay are unaffected, but it still benefits from the increased guard damage reduction and duration.
Exotic Weapons
Fixed an issue where ammo was loading into Quicksilver Storm slightly too late in the reload animation.
Fixed the impact stat on Dead Man's Tale. This is cosmetic only, damage per bullet is unchanged.
Two-Tailed Fox's catalyst perk Third Tail has been reworked. Two-Tailed Fox now fires all 3 shots burst-fire with the catalyst, instead of firing 3 rockets in 2 bursts.
This improves the weapon's consistency and prevents situations where the rockets could collide mid-flight.
Slightly increased the direct impact damage of the catalyst Arc rocket.
Verglas Curve
Whisper of Fissures detonations now generate Hail Barrage stacks if the crystal was created by this weapon.
Shiver Quiver now activates when slowing enemies.
Increased the slow stacks from 40 to 60 when hitting players directly with Hail Barrage arrows. This allows for a freeze if two Hail Barrage arrows hit the same player.
Le Monarque
Reduced draw time from 684 milliseconds to 612 milliseconds.
Reduced body shot damage from 100 to 85.

Pulse Rifles

At 0 Aim Assist, reduced the auto aim angle by ~10%.
Bows

Lightweight
Increased final accuracy by ~10%.
Developer note: In the mid-Season patch preview we erroneously included a change to lightweight Bow damage falloff distance. Bows do not currently have damage falloff, in large part due to an issue where they could fail to be hit scan at longer ranges. This can cause inconsistent hit registration, so also having them lose damage felt overly punishing. In Season 22 we have corrected the issue, and we preemptively set Bows up to be able to have damage falloff, but it is not currently enabled.

Trials of Osiris
The game mode for Trials of Osiris is moving from Elimination to Dominion.
The intro quest has been updated to better serve as an onboarding path to Trials, and it now offers new players a reward for completing it.
The Flawless pool will no longer activate on Sunday, and the Challenger and Practice soft pools will be active all weekend. ("Soft" means that matchmaking initially prefers not to blend the pools but will, if necessary to find a good game quickly.)
If you are on your first game of the week or playing on a card with a loss recorded on it, you will be placed in the Practice pool.
The Practice pool utilizes weekly performance and connection-based matchmaking.
If you are playing on Flawless card or playing with someone on a Flawless card, you will be placed in the Challenger pool.
The Challenger pool utilizes only connection-based matchmaking.

This bonus reward was previously exclusive to the Flawless pool starting on Sunday, but it will now be active all weekend and does not require you to be in a specific pool.
The chance of getting an Adept from a win has been slightly reduced to account for the increased duration and availability of the bonus.
The Gilded Flawless requirements have been updated.
A new emblem has been added which is rewarded for going Flawless without ever trailing in any wins on the card.

Fixed an unintended interaction between sandbox abilities and defeated combatant bodies that would cause Persys in Spire of the Watcher to be deleted.
Fixed a rare issue where players would not be able to farm Artifice armor in Master difficult of Grasp of Avarice while it's active in the rotator.

However, blocking with Whirlwind Guard will no longer consume energy more slowly and the Super drains 30% slower down from 50% slower.
Radiant Dance Machines: Kills while your free dodge is active extend the duration of free dodging. No longer deactivates when you get too far away from enemies. Deactivates after using Suspending Slam.
ST0MP-EE5: Removed airborne effectiveness penalties. You only gain the increased speed, slide distance, and improved jumping while your dodge energy is full.

While using a Void subclass, rapid Shotgun final blows or defeating a powerful enemy with a Shotgun grants you a Void overshield and kicks off your health regeneration.
Second Chance: Shield throw melee now weakens enemies. Stunning a Barrier Champion with your shield throw melee grants a single full melee charge.
Stronghold: Replaced the healing from blocking shots precisely with significant damage reduction (50% in PvE, 10% in PvP) while blocking with a Sword. When you stop blocking, gain restoration x2, with a duration that increases based on the number of shots you blocked.
Eternal Warrior: Rapid takedowns with an Arc weapon grant an escalating bonus to Arc weapon damage, using the same non-stacking damage bonuses used by Surge mods. This can go all the way up to the tier-4 damage bonus, granting a damage bonus in PvE of 25% and granting a 6% bonus to weapon damage in PvP. While at the tier-4 damage bonus, Arc kills refresh the bonus's duration. After your Fist of Havoc Super ends, you gain the tier-4 damage bonus.
Khepri's Horn: The Solar damage wave now scorches targets.
Path of the Burning Steps: Changed to use the non-stacking weapon damage bonuses used by Surge mods. This can go all the way up to the tier-4 damage bonus, granting a damage bonus in PvE of 25% and granting a 6% bonus to weapon damage in PvP. While at the tier-4 damage bonus, Solar kills refresh the bonus's duration. Becoming encased immediately grants you the tier-4 damage bonus.
Dunemarchers: Reduced the range of the chain damage from 20m to 12m and PvP damage from 85 to 50.
Warlock
Vesper of Radius: Your rifts emit an Arc shockwave every 5 seconds that deals damage (200 in PvE, 70 in PvP). Enemies defeated by these shockwaves explode for an additional 100 damage. If you have an Arc subclass equipped, the shockwaves and the explosions created when they defeat an enemy also blind nearby enemies.
Chromatic Fire: Increased the radius and damage of the explosion created by prevision Kinetic takedowns. The explosion also applies a status effect to targets damaged by it, depending on which subclass you have equipped: blind (Arc), scorch (Solar), slow (Stasis), sever (Strand), weaken (Void).
Dawn Chorus: Daybreak projectiles deal increased damage. Daybreak damage bonus no longer limited to scorched enemies.
Sanguine Alchemy: Standing in a rift grants a non-stacking bonus to weapon damage matching your subclass damage type (17% PvE, 4.5% PvP).
Claws of Ahamkara: Powered melee kills create an Orb of Power. When Heavy Handed mods are equipped, increases the potency of the Orb spawned (no more than 1 Orb can be spawned per enemy takedown).
Mantle of Battle Harmony: Changed damage bonus to weapons when Super is full changed to tier-4 non-stacking weapon damage bonus, increasing damage bonus in PvE from 20% to 25% and reducing the damage bonus from 15% to 6% in PvP. Damage bonus only applies to weapons that match your subclass damage type, and now stacks with Empowering Rift and other similar damage bonuses. Extended base duration of this bonus from 6 seconds to 10 seconds (PvE) and 3 seconds to 5 seconds (PvP).
Ophidian Aspect: Removed the extended melee range.
Promethium Spur: Grants rift energy for any Solar weapon takedown, with more energy granted for Solar weapon takedowns while standing in a rift. You now have to be standing in a rift when you get a final blow for the Exotic to consume your class ability energy and create a rift at the target's location.
Starfire Protocol: Reduced the amount of energy gained per instance of damage from 20% to 2.5%. Empowered weapon kills now grant 20% grenade energy.

Last Wish weapons can now be crafted. Each week, players can visit Hawthorne in the Tower to acquire a pursuit to complete all encounters of the Last Wish raid. Completion will award guaranteed Last Wish pattern progress until all patterns are acquired. In addition, completion of the pursuit will unlock a vendor exchange on Hawthorne for that week where players can spend Spoils of Conquest to purchase 1 additional Deepsight weapon from a selection of Last Wish weapons they've previously obtained.
Players can now obtain a limited number of Deepsight Harmonizers from the Season Pass. On a weapon with an available pattern that has never had Deepsight, a player can apply this currency to immediately give the weapon Deepsight for Pattern Extraction through Deepsight Activation." Weapons will have an information section display if a weapon is available for Deepsight Activation.

Fixed an issue where the brief rate of fire increases on Aggressive Shotguns after getting a kill could be sustained after swapping off the Shotgun immediately after a kill.

Scout Rifles
Fixed an issue where the Long Arm Scout Rifle was getting the PvE damage bonus for Exotics.
Grenade Launchers
Fixed an issue where some Grenade Launcher explosions were missing their proper visual effects.

Reduced base damage from 15 to 14.
Increased precision hit multiplier from 1.45 to 1.5 (crit damage goes from 21.8 to 21).

The Manticore
Increased the catalyst's damage resistance from tier 3 to tier 4.
Increased movement speed during hang time.
Activating the catalyst perk (through an airborne kill or sustained damage following an airborne kill) now partially refills the magazine.
Fixed an issue allowing players to hover around with the Manticore while frozen or suspended. Becoming frozen or suspended now ends the Manticore's hover effect.

Skyburner's Oath
Increased scorch stacks from 3 to 5 and 5 to 10 with the Ember of Ashes Fragment.
Salvation's Grip
Reworked to have 2 firing modes. Charged shot creates a pattern of Stasis crystals (where the number of crystals is no longer dependent on charge time). Uncharged shot is a normal Grenade Launcher shot, but does more damage to Stasis crystals and frozen targets.
New perk added that reloads the magazine from reserves when you quickly shatter at least 3 crystals with the uncharged shot.
Bad Juju

Veriglas Curve
Fixed an issue causing Verglas Curve's Stasis crystals to fail to spawn if shot at a titan bubble.

Fixed an issue where Tractor Cannon was impacted by the recent non-lethal collision damage changes.
Now causes hit targets to be able to suffer lethal collision damage for a brief duration.
Thunderlord
Fixed an issue with Thunderlord where damaging a target under the effects of Divinity's debuffcould cause lightning strikes with unintentional frequency, as the hit would count as two precision hits, instead of one.
Miscellaneous and Visual
Exotics with lock-on reticles, like Ticuu's Divination, Final Warning, and Eyes of Tomorrow should no longer auto-target allied Tangles and grapple points.
Fixed an issue that was causing the special first-person recoil animation on Cryosthesia 77k's special shot to play incorrectly.
This is an animation-only change.
Symmetry's visual effects are no longer persistent on screen if you switch weapons while the special fire mode is active.
Fixed an issue on Sleeper Simulant's weapon model that was causing the display screen to be an incorrect color.

Now provides its effects even when the weapon is stowed.
For example, a rocket shot from a Rocket Launcher with Vorpal Weapon will retain the damage increase against bosses even if you swap to another weapon.
Subsistence
Fixed an issue where the effects of the Subsistence perk could cause Reservoir Burst to fail to activate under certain networking conditions.
Adagio
No longer resets by destroying Stasis crystals.

Lightning Surge
Fixed an issue allowing Lightning Surge to deal more instances of secondary strike damage than intended - now targets can take a maximum of two instances of damage from a single activation of the ability: one from the primary lightning strike around the player, and one from a secondary lightning strike.
This change necessitated some changes in damage values, but in general its damage output should be significantly more consistent and slightly higher than the intended value previously, but without the ability to one-shot a single enemy Guardian from full health.
Ball Lightning
Increased damage vs. PvE combatants by 30%
Reduced ping scalar on downward lightning strike detonations so combatants are less likely to flinch out of the repeated lightning strike volume while the player is amplified.

Seasonal armor and ornament name corrections:
Season of Defiance released with the Techeun-styled activity armor called the "Unyielding Favor Set," with the "Techeun's Regalia Set" as the name for the Seasonal ornaments.

Fixed an issue where the Terminal Overload chest could be looted multiple times for rewards and crafted weapon progress.
Crafting progress now comes from the key chest and not the base chest.
When the mods Ashes to Ashes and Hands On are equipped at the same time, players will only receive Super energy from one of the mods when killing an enemy with a grapple melee. When these mods are equipped individually, each will work with the grapple melee.
Grenade Kickstart will no longer activate when using a grapple point.
When the mods Firepower and Heavy Handed are equipped at the same time, only one Orb of Power will spawn when killing an enemy with a grapple melee. When these mods are equipped individually, each will work with the grapple melee.
Reduced Super gains from Ashes to Assets by 50% when getting a grapple melee kill after using a grapple point.
Players no longer need to have the Strand subclass equipped to gain Unraveling Rounds for their Strand weapons from the Allied Unraveling perk.
Heavy weapons will more consistently gain increased ammo capacity from multiple Reserves mods. This does not apply to Rocket Launchers, Grenade Launchers, Heavy Glaives, Leviathan's Breath, and One Thousand Voices, since their maximum ammo capacity is reached by equipping fewer mods.
Fixed an issue where the Fighting Lion Grenade Launcher was incorrectly benefitting from the Void Holster mod.
Fixed an issue where the Harsh Language Shotgun now correctly activates Void artifact perks.
Fall damage is now nonlethal to players. Previously, only collision damage was nonlethal.

ARMOR MODS
Fixed an issue where equipping too many passive Armor Charge benefits would deactivate artifact perks.
Changed Empowered Finish to count as a finisher mod for purposes of mutual exclusivity. This mod can no longer be equipped alongside a finisher mod that also consumes Armor Charge stacks.
Having the ability to generate and spend Armor Charge stacks on the same mod was creating conditions where latency would sometimes cause the perks to activate in an incorrect order.
Additionally, when combined with Stacks on Stacks, Empowering Finish was circumventing the basic Armor Charge mechanics too easily, resulting in generating too many Orbs of Power, ammo bricks, overshields, etc.
The Untangler Artifact perk will no longer trigger melee perks.
Localization
Fixed the issue introduced in 7.0.0.5 that reverted Mandarin voice over to English.
General
Increased the time to give Commendations to other players after finishing certain activities.

Destiny 2 Hotfix 7.0.0.3

Destiny 2 Update 7.0.0.1
ACTIVITIES
CRUCIBLE

Added an Exotic Armor Swap penalty applied to Trials of Osiris and Competitive Division. Equipping a different piece of Exotic armor drains all ability energy in these modes.
Competitive Division
Fixed a bug that caused the Competitive intro quest to auto-claim the completion reward. Rewards are now claimed upon interacting with Shaxx.
Competitive Rift & Showdown have reduced revive delay time to 1.5s from 2s; reduced respawn time to 5.5s from 7s.
VANGUARD OPS

Fixed an issue in Heist Battleground: Europa where a Heavy ammo crate could respawn for players who get quarantined into the boss fight arena.
When you play Vanguard Ops or Nightfall, your final score determines a reputation multiplier for that activity's completion. Multipliers run from 1.0 (under 30,000 points) to 7.0 (above 250,000). We also tuned the amount of Vanguard rank you receive for completions, Nightfall quality, and streaks.
Full pass on all Vanguard map and mode multipliers, with an eye toward balancing score-per-hour, rather than score-per-attempt.
Vanguard and Nightfall strikes: Added on-screen health bar for bosses previously missing them.
Fixed an issue where player could be given the same objective twice in quick succession in The Devil's Lair strike.
The Vanguard Ops playlist has increased in difficulty - players can no longer level beyond the enemy combatants.
Additional rotating modifiers have been added to the Vanguard Ops playlist.
DIFFICULTY OPTIONS

Hero, Legend, and Master difficulties have been reworked for greater challenge and to accommodate new modifiers. Adept difficulty has been removed.
Hero activity level is now soft cap + 20. Legend is Power cap + 30, and Master is Power cap + 40. Each has a scaling combat delta that keeps you under level in the activity and provides a smoother pathway to Grandmaster.
Most Hero/Legend/Master/Grandmaster activities now feature the ability to use "overcharged" weapons for increased damage. Which weapons are overcharged are determined by your Seasonal Artifact unlocks and activity modifiers.
Elemental singes and burns have been replaced and broken out into incoming and outgoing components: "threats" and "surges". Damage bonuses for surges and overcharges do not stack.
RAIDS AND DUNGEONS

Armor pieces from Master difficulty Grasp of Avarice, Duality, and Spire of the Watcher drop with higher stats.
UI/UX
Lightfall title screen
The title screen has received a visual and audio update for Lightfall.
Guardian Ranks
UI throughout Destiny 2 has been updated to display player's Guardian Rank.
Orbit Screen
Added a button to directly access the Journey tab.
Triumphs tab Journey tab
When building the Guardian Ranks feature, the team leaned into the opportunity to refresh and relabel the Triumphs tab to better encapsulate the player's journey through Destiny 2.
Many of the changes will be immediately visible but some are more subtle including:
An access point to view details about the Commendations you have sent and received.
An additional access point for Seasonal Challenges.
Seals are no longer broken into two categories - Seals and Titles - they are just Titles.
Additionally, to focus the information shown at the top level, both Triumphs and Titles have been migrated to bespoke sub-screens.
Added the ability to equip/unequip Titles from the sub-screen rather than going into the details screen.
Commendations
Commendations may be sent and received near the end of most activities.
Accessibility
In all locations where Commendations may be viewed or given, the player's Colorblind preferences are respected.
This includes VFX in the post-game carnage report.
Post Game Carnage Report (PGCR)
Updated the PGCR to complement the new Commendations feature and updated some features.
The PGCR now consists of two tabs, the Commendations screen and the scoreboard.
The reputation wheel has been simplified and is displayed on the top right of the scoreboard page.
The player can now access the PGCR during the mission end countdown by pressing a button to open Nav mode. Holding it down will still take you to the Director.
A tradeoff for this functionally is that when the mission end countdown is active the Nav mode cannot be opened. Pressing a button to open Nav mode will open the PGCR instead.
Ritual Rank Tooltips
Updated rank tooltips so all rank tooltips now include a streak tracker and added a section that shows a player's total reputation rank points.
Tracking
More items can be tracked at a time:
Up to three Guardian Ranks objectives can be tracked.
Up to six non-Guardian Ranks objectives can be tracked.
Nav mode updates:
A tab has been added specifically to display tracked Guardian Ranks objectives.
Tracked objectives that are not specific to Guardian Ranks are grouped together.
Tracking now split into multiple sections on the Journey tab.
Guardian Ranks section specifically shows tracked Guardian Ranks objectives.
All currently trackable, non-quest objectives are shown below the Seasonal Challenges access point.
Guardian Ranks auto-tracking is enabled by default.
The goal is to immediately point players towards objectives they can work on to increase their Guardian Rank.
This may be toggled on the Journey screen if manual tracking is more your speed.
Tracked Seasonal Challenges properly display their challenge type in its tooltip on the tracking screen.
Collections
Some access points have migrated from the Triumphs tab to the Collections tab:
Lore
Weapon patterns & catalysts
Medals
Stat trackers
Increased the number of visible 'recently discovered' items.
Waypoints
Rectangles are out. Circles are in.
Guardian Ranks replaces Season Pass level for Guardians.
Records
In order to help call out which Guardian Rank records are Seasonal, a blue gradient has been added to the bottom of all Seasonal records including those on the Seasonal Challenges screen.
Vendors
Ritual vendors in the Tower (Zavala, Shaxx, Drifter, Banshee-44, Saladin, Saint-14) now have help tooltips describing the core ritual and reputation, as well as explaining some of the less visible features.
QOL UPDATES AND FIXES

Character screen
Removed the currency display on the Character screen.
Clans
Fixed an issue where Hawthorne's icon on the Tower map wouldn't consistently pulse when a clan engram was available to claim.
Roster
Improved contrast between player names and background colors on the Roster.
Fixed an issue causing the Director screen to refresh the footer UI when players in the Roster changed states.
Settings
Fixed an issue causing the Settings menu to close when leaving a submenu.
GAMEPLAY AND INVESTMENT
ARMOR

Armor energy type has been deprecated. Armor now has untyped armor energy, and all mods use that untyped energy when socketed.
Armor mods that were previously based on weapon archetype are now based on weapon damage type.
Most armor mods that are based on weapon damage type also have a harmonic version, which is discounted when the weapon's damage type matches your subclass damage type.
Armor mod costs have been generally reduced across the board.
The Combat Style mod socket has been deprecated and replaced on all armor pieces with an extra socket for mods associated with that armor slot (helmet, gauntlets, etc.).
The Charged With Light and Elemental Wells armor mods have been merged into a single system: Armor Charge.
Players using the Armor Charge system can gain up to three stacks of Armor Charge at a time (expanded up to six stacks by equipping Charged Up mods).
Picking up an Orb of Power grants one stack of Armor Charge.
Many mods that previously created Elemental Wells or granted stacks of Charged With Light directly have been modified to instead spawn Orbs of Power.
Mods that provide an ongoing benefit (such as Font of Wisdom) now grant that benefit as long as you have stacks of Armor Charge; these mods cause Armor Charge stacks to decay every 10 seconds.
Some redundant mods have been deprecated when their effect would overlap with an existing mod's effects.
Some armor mods (such as the Kickstart mods and most mods triggered by using a finisher) now make use of the Armor Charge system.
Some of the functionality of Elemental Wells and their associated mods have been moved into subclass fragments and the new Firesprite and Void Breech.
Warmind Cells have been deprecated.
Seasonal Artifact
Unlocking a perk in the Seasonal Artifact now grants that perk directly to the character when it is relevant; you no longer need to socket an armor mod to gain an Artifact perk's effect.
Column 2 of the Artifact now unlocks multiple discounted mods per node.
The maximum number of unlocked perks has been reduced to 12.
Resetting your selections in the Seasonal Artifact is now free.
Removed the one-second button hold to unlock an Artifact perk; a single button press now unlocks the perk.
Artifice armor has had its bonus socket converted into a socket that allows you to increase any one stat on that armor piece by +3.
Adjusted the amount of damage reduction provided by the Resilience stat in PvE. At tier 10 damage reduction now caps at 30% (down from 40% in Season 19), and the progression of the damage reduction across tiers has been smoothed to give more relative value to lower tiers of Resilience.
The armor mods granting Resilience have had their armor energy costs increased to 4 (+10 Resilience) and 2 (+5 Resilience).
The Iron Lord's Pride perk has been added to all Iron Banner armor sets from Season 8 to the present.
Exotic Armor changes
Khepri's Sting: Truesight is now granted when damaging an enemy with a smoke bomb. Additionally, when you have an undetonated smoke bomb on the battlefield and have not been made invisible by a smoke bomb, you gain significantly increased melee energy generation.
Heart of Inmost Light: Reduced duration of the empowered ability buffs in PvE to five seconds (down from 10 seconds). Reduced bonus class ability regeneration while empowered to +25% per stack in both PvE and PvP (down from +150% and +38%, respectively).
This change is intended to decrease how easy it is to get and maintain a 2x empowerment bonus in PvE, as well as reduce the total amount of bonus ability energy provided. The goal is for Heart of Inmost light to remain strong in ability-focused builds, while giving room for other Exotics to shine as well.

Chromatic Fire has been updated to work with Strand.

SEASONAL UPDATES: ENGRAMS, ENERGY, FOCUSING, CHESTS, AND KEYS

Umbral engrams are no longer used to focus seasonal weapons and armor and will no longer drop from the game.
As a result, there will no longer be Seasonal umbral energy.
Seasonal engrams are a new type of engram.
You can visit the seasonal vendor to open them.
Or you can spend multiple seasonal engrams to focus into specific weapons or armor.
Seasonal focusing is now a separate screen and can be accessed at the vendor by pressing the button next to upgrades.
If you focused Crucible engrams in Season 19 at Shaxx, you'll be familiar with this system.
Seasonal engrams are stored at the vendor and do not require inventory space.
There is a wallet item you can acquire by visiting the seasonal vendor. Hovering over this item in your inventory will show you how many engrams you have for each vendor. If you delete this item, you can reacquire it from the vendor.
Owners of a season will now periodically be rewarded with a seasonal engram and/or a seasonal key upon completing activities throughout the game.
These are known as defiant engrams and defiant keys for Season of Defiance.
Playlist versions of the seasonal battlegrounds have one chest at the end of the activity.
If you DO NOT have a seasonal key when you open that chest, you will receive a seasonal weapon or armor.
If you DO have a seasonal key, it will be consumed and you will receive the following:
EITHER a seasonal weapon with Deepsight resonance that you have not completed the crafting pattern for OR a high stat piece of seasonal armor.
AND a seasonal engram.
Make sure you open the chest at the end of the activity!
World pool weapons and armor no longer drop at the end of the playlist version of seasonal activities.

Gameplay and Investment
Armor

Headseeker
Body shots now increase your precision multiplier and increase aim assist. Additional body shots reset the timer.
It has a 0.55s base timer. Body shots while the perk is active reset the timer.
Encore
Final blows now grant stacks of Encore. Stacks grant increased stability, range, and accuracy (+8 stability, +5 range, and +1.25% accuracy per stack).
Body shot final blows grant one stack, precision final blows grant two stacks, with a maximum of four stacks.
Lasts 7s, Enhanced Encore lasts 7.5s. Final blows refresh the timer.

The duration of these buffs can now be refreshed if activated while already active.

With the addition of the Full Auto setting, we've replaced the Full Auto Trigger System perk with something else on each weapon that had it.

The Rock perk:
Increased damage by 60% in PvE.
Increased damage at the outer edge damage radius from 0% to 20%.

The timer is refreshed when landing hits.
Rat King
Radius required to activate its perk increased from 15m to 20m.
Legend of Acrius
Removed movement penalties.
Bastion
Reduced spread angle by 6%.
This halves the effect of Season 14's spread angle increase.
Quicksilver Storm
Increased PvP maximum grenade damage from 80 to 120. Increased explosion radius from 3m to 4m.
Switched rocket damage from Arc to Kinetic.
Coldheart
Reduced cooldown on Ionic Trace generation from 3.5s to 2s.
Now maxes out stability and reload speed when at maximum damage.

Abilities
Solar subclasses
Gunslinger
Knock 'Em Down
Golden Gun
Now provides 15% bonus damage resistance to Deadshot Golden Gun, and no longer provides bonus duration.
No longer provides 15% bonus damage resistance to Marksman Golden Gun.
Note: After seeing this play out in the wild, it was clear that there wasn't enough differentiation between Deadshot and Marksman Golden Gun, primarily due to Deadshot benefiting significantly more from Knock 'Em Down's bonus duration (as seen by the number of Seventh, Eighth, and Fourteenth Column videos in recent months). We want to push these two enhanced Supers further apart and solidify Marksman Golden Gun as the option where you can take your time to aim your shot from range, and Deadshot as a more in-the-fray option. We believed that doubling up on bonuses and the bonus duration was confusing these identities and not giving them enough space to breathe.
Blade Barrage
Blade Barrage bonus projectiles reduced from 5 to 3 per group. It now releases a total of 20 knives (+43% from base), down from 24.
Note: While it was refreshing to see Blade Barrage topping the charts as a change of pace, the stacking bonuses from Patch 6.1.0's PvE damage increase and consistency improvements and Knock 'Em Down's bonus knives, in combination with other buildcrafting elements, pushed the burst damage of Blade Barrage above where we were comfortable with burst Supers being. We believe this will still be a strong option for burst damage without being as much of an outlier.
Dawnblade
Celestial Fire
Increased close-range melee damage from 90 to 100, so players using Celestial Fire and the auto-melee option are no longer disadvantaged in close-range melee fights.
General
Ember of Torches
Radiant base duration reduced from 10s to 8s.
Now applies a -10 Discipline penalty while equipped.
Ember of Solace
Now provides a 50% bonus to Radiant duration, rather than a flat 5s.
Note: this is consistent with its behavior with Restoration.
Restoration
Restoration x1 base healing rate reduced from 25 to 20 health per second (40 health per second in PvE activities, down from 50).
Restoration x2 base healing rate reduced from 40 to 32.5 health per second (65 health per second in PvE activities, down from 80).
No longer stacks with Healing Rift's healing. The stronger heal-over-time value is prioritized and will stop the weaker heal-over-time from taking effect.
Void subclasses
Nightstalker
Shadowshot: Deadfall
Increased tether anchor lifetime when triggered from 8s to 12s.
Shadowshot: Moebius Quiver
Reduced tether anchor lifetime when triggered from 8s to 6s.
Sentinel
Shield Bash
Improved reliability of the suppression application when hitting the primary target under poor network conditions.
Voidwalker
Nova Bomb: Vortex
Increased initial projectile speed by 21%.
Increased radius of the inward pull impulse on impact by ~17%.
Increased strength of the inward pull impulse on impact by ~20%.
Note: Vortex Nova Bomb has felt like a niche option for a while now, and we want to improve its viability relative to Cataclysm Nova Bomb by doubling down on its unique pull impulse. We also felt like it was too easy to undershoot targets at close-to-mid ranges. Increasing the initial projectile speed should help players catch their intended target more reliably.
General
Void Overshield
Fixed an issue where the Void overshield was only providing 25% PvE-only damage resistance to the overshield, rather than the intended 50%.
Stasis Subclasses
Revenant
Winter's Shroud
Fragment slots increased from 1 to 2.
Shadebinder
Glacial Harvest
Reduced cooldown on Stasis shard creation (per 6 shards) from 15sto 10s.
Behemoth
Cryoclasm
Fragment slots increased from 1 to 2.
Stasis Grenades
Duskfield Grenade
Increased slow stack application rate on players by 13%.
Coldsnap Grenade
Coldsnap can now track targets for 0.5s after creation, rather than immediately finding a target and traveling toward their last known position.
Note: Base Coldsnap grenade was not meeting our reliability bar and was too frequently getting stuck in the environment or missing targets that had not significantly changed position. Our goal with this change is to increase Coldsnap's reliability without compromising the ability for potential victims to relocate and avoid being frozen.
General
Stasis Slow
Increased movement speed penalty while Slowed by 10%.
Whisper of Rending
Now provides bonus damage to Stasis crystals and frozen targets for all Primary weapons, rather than just Kinetic Primary weapons.
Arc Subclasses
Arcstrider
Tempest Strike
Increased Tempest Strike damage against PvE combatants by 30%.
Striker
Ballistic Slam
Increased Ballistic Slam damage against PvE combatants by 16%.
Touch of Thunder
Storm Grenade
Decreased Touch of Thunder's Storm Grenade base roaming duration from 5s to 4s.
Decreased the bonus lifetime granted by Spark of Magnitude to the enhanced Storm Grenade from 2s to 1.5s.
Fixed an issue that caused the enhanced Storm Grenade's effective area to be difficult to understand in PvP.
Previously, the friend-or-foe ring surrounding a Touch of Thunder Storm Grenade's lightning strikes blinked on and off between strikes, and there was no indication within the cloud itself of whether or not it was friend or foe. Now, the ring persists through the life of the storm, and enemy storms have an additional VFX layer in the cloud itself to help differentiate them from those created by allies.
Stormcaller
Ball Lightning
Increased travel distance from 27.5m to 35m.
Chain Lightning
Increased damage against PvE combatants by 50%.
Arc Soul
Increased base damage vs. PvE combatants from 35 to 60.
Note: With the release of Season 18, we increased Arc Soul's base damage in PvE from 25 to 35, but it's clear that wasn't enough to help them feel particularly useful in very high-end PvE activities, so we decided to swing harder this time. We'll be keeping an eye on this one as the Season progresses to make sure these are landing where we'd hoped.
Chaos Reach
Reduced base cooldown from 9:16 to 7:35.
Power and Progression
Fixed an issue where Shaw Han's supply chest in the Cosmodrome could award items that have been removed from the game.
Fixed an issue where Europa and Beyond Light content may have been inaccessible to some players.
Focusing
You can no longer preview a focusing engram where you have no eligible items to decrypt.
Dares of Eternity
Daily and weekly bounties from Xûr and Starhorse now reward Strange Favor reputation.
The amount of Strange Favor reputation earned by completing Dares on Legend difficulty has been increased.
Destiny 2: Year-4 weapons and armor sets and Tangled Shore armor sets have been added to the Dares of Eternity reward pool.
Destiny 2: Year-3 weapons and older, no longer available, destination armor sets (from Io, Mars, Mercury, and Titan) have been removed from the Dares of Eternity reward pool.
Destination Materials
All existing in-game sources of destination materials will be disabled. Players will no longer earn destination materials via interacting with resource nodes, opening chests, completing public events, finishing strikes, etc.
Harvesting resource nodes will now grant Glimmer and XP directly instead of destination materials,
Destination materials removed:
Glacial Starwort - Europa
Dusklight Shard - EDZ
Helium Filaments - Luna
Spinmetal Leaves - Cosmodrome
Baryon Bough - Dreaming City
Microphasic Datalattice - Nessus
Material Exchange
Rahool will no longer sell destination materials.
Players who have destination materials on their account will still be able to exchange them for Glimmer at Rahool, although at a reduced rate compared to what is currently offered.
Current exchange rate: 20 destination materials = 10,000 Glimmer.
Rahool will provide context sensitive offers that will display depending on how many of each material players have in their inventory, offers will be invisible to players who do not have any destination materials.
New exchange rate: 20 destination materials = 5,000 Glimmer.
Offers are Only visible if players have more than 20 of the associated material in their inventory.
New exchange rate: 1 destination material = 250 Glimmer.
Offers are only visible if players have less than 20, but more than zero of the associated material in their inventory.
This will be the only use for destination materials beyond Season 19.
These offers are unavailable for previously deprecated materials such as Etheric Spirals, Alkane Dust, Phaseglass Needles, or Seraphite.
We don't want players to feel bad if they have thrown these resources away.
Rahool now allows players to exchange the following materials for Glimmer:
Dark Fragment
Phantasmal Fragment
Herealways Piece
Vendors
Destination material cost has been removed from Upgrade Module purchases.
Purchasing costs for the Monument to Lost Lights will see the destination material costs replaced with Legendary Shard costs.
As mentioned earlier in these patch notes, the Kill-Tracker Ghost Shell will no longer appear on Lord Shaxx if it has already been acquired. It may be reacquired from Collections.
Devrim Kay and Failsafe will see their current reputation system, which required players to spend Dusklight Shards and Microphasic Datalattice, respectively, removed.
Currently out of scope to create new reputation system akin to what we saw with Finch on Throneworld.
These vendors will no longer sell sunset weapons.
Destination armor will be available for purchase without requiring players to earn ranks with the vendor.
Cost will be 1000 Glimmer and 25 Legendary Shards.
Emblems and rewards that were once unlocked through ranking up vendor will become purchasable on vendor.
Ghost Shell Cost: 10 Legendary Shards.
Emblem Cost: 25 Legendary Shards.
Increase the number of daily bounties available at the vendor from 3 to 4 to be in line with other destinations.
Ghost Mods
The following Ghost Mods will be removed as they no longer will have any functionality in the game:
Materialism (Vanguard)
Materialism (Crucible)

The Following Ghost Mods will see changes to their functionality:
Public Defender: no longer increases destination material acquisition, now offers increased Glimmer rewards.

Platforms and Systems
Fixed an issue where, after joining a player through a Bungie invite, attempting to join a different player by accepting a platform invite will send them to first player's fireteam.
Fixed an issue where emblems rewarded by completing the King's Fall raid or raid carries are missed by the raid metrics category.
Fixed an issue where chat disabled via in-game settings would remain inactive when players try to engage by text in the chat.
General
Fixed an issue where subclass emblems were not properly unlocked with New Light completion.
Localization
French Exo Stranger voice talent has been recast.
Spanish Castilian Exo Stranger voice talent has been recast.
Russian Mara Sov was temporary recast for Season 19.
Original talent will come back for future releases.
Lightfall expansion renamed for Portuguese-BR to Queda da Luz.

Destiny 2 Hotfix 6.2.5.4
Activities
Seasonal
Fixed an issue where players were not able to acquire Scallywag Seal due to being blocked by the Semaphore Signals Triumph. The Semaphore Signals Triumph is no longer needed for Scallywag Seal.
Players can still unlock the Semaphore Signals Triumph for Triumph score and hear that sweet, sweet narrative radio content by proceeding on their Sails of the Shipstealer quest.
If players have a character that has finished the quest but are blocked by this issue, they must progress on characters that have not yet finished the quest.
For maximum efficiency in unlocking radio content, we don't advise progressing on this quest on multiple characters.
Beware: only one radio entry can be played per-visit to Eliksni Quarter. If players have made significant progress through the Sails of the Shipstealer quest such that they have multiple radio entries available, they will need to go to orbit and return to Eliksni Quarter between each radio usage.
Dialogs in Ketchcrash and Expedition will now respect a character's progress through the Seasonal narrative and play contextually appropriate lines.

Destiny 2 Hotfix 6.2.5.3
Gameplay and Investment

Weapon Balance
Linear Fusion Rifles

General
Increased the flinch received from player damage.

Fixed an issue where Combination Blow's melee energy regeneration bonus was also applying while Tempest Strike was equipped.
Developer Note: Typically, we do not normalize melee ability regeneration rates for melee modifications like Tempest Strike or Consecration, as most of our melee abilities have a relatively small delta in base cooldown times between them. However, because the cooldown reduction on Combination Blow is so significant and integral to the base melee's behavior, we chose to do so here in order to have a better grasp on where Tempest Strike lies in terms of efficacy and uptime, which would have been difficult with a potentially 15-second cooldown time. 
Fixed an issue where the damage resistance provided by the Flow State Aspect and Arc Staff Super while dodging was significantly higher than intended in PvP.
Fixed an issue where the Striker and Stormcaller subclasses were not benefiting from resilience-based PvE damage resistance and incoming flinch reduction.

Reworked to fit the Subclass 3.0 system. There are too many individual systemic changes to list here, but the Arc subclasses now use the Aspect and Fragment system used by Stasis, Void, and Solar.
Standardized a set of buffs and debuffs aligned to the Arc damage type:
Amplified - Your movement speed and weapon handling are greatly increased. After sprinting for a short time, you enter Speed Booster, further increasing your sprint speed and granting damage resistance against PvE combatants.
By default, rapidly defeating multiple targets with Arc damage will amplify you. Your equipped Aspects and Fragments provide additional methods to become and benefit from being amplified.
Ionic Trace - A bolt of pure Arc energy that travels along the ground, seeking its creator. When picked up, Ionic Traces grant grenade, melee, and class ability energy.
Blind - Combatants are disoriented and cannot fire their weapons. Enemy players' HUD is removed and their vision is obscured.
Jolted - The target is energized with destructive Arc Light. As they take additional damage while jolted, they chain lightning to nearby enemies. This chain lightning can occur multiple times while a target is jolted.
Hovering over Aspects, Fragments, or abilities on the Arc subclass screen now displays a tooltip flyout detailing any relevant status effects.
Some old subclass perks have been deprecated, while others have been rolled into base ability behavior, Fragments, or Aspects with some changes to behavior as a result.

New Super added: Gathering Storm
Hurl your Arc Staff forward, embedding it into surfaces or large targets, dealing damage to and jolting nearby targets. After a short time, a devastating lightning bolt strikes the staff, overcharging it with Arc energy. While overcharged, your staff discharges lightning at nearby foes.
New jump added: Blink
Arc Hunters have recovered from a not-so-brief case of amnesia causing them to forget how to Blink.

Light attack energy cost normalized between previous top and bottom tree cost at 8% (previously 12%/5.6%).
Heavy slam radius normalized between the previous top and bottom tree cost at 7 meters (previously 8m/6m).
Fists of Havoc damage vs. Champion, miniboss, and boss combatants increased by 25%. Damage vs. minor and elite combatants increased by ~40%.
Note: Previously, Fists of Havoc relied on knockout bonus damage and trample energy refunds to consistently deal with standard combatants in PvE. We'd like this to be better able to stand on its own now to partially compensate for the increased attack energy costs.
New class ability added: Thruster
Activate while grounded to perform a quick, first-person lateral evade.
New melee ability added: Thunderclap
Hold melee while grounded to plant your feet and begin charging your fist with Arc energy. Release melee to punch forward, unleashing a large blast of force that deals additional damage the longer the melee button was held.
Seismic Strike
Blind duration decreased from 5 seconds to 1.6 seconds vs. players.
Now while amplified, the blinding radius is increased from 7m to 10m, and the blind duration is increased to 3 seconds vs. players.
Ballistic Slam
Fixed an issue where the Ballistic Slam camera could sometimes cause you to dive straight down rather than at your aimed location.
No longer applies Inertia Override on hit.
Knockout
Defeating targets with melee attacks now also amplifies you in addition to starting your health regeneration.
Knockout is no longer consumed on your next melee kill. Instead, knockout lasts for a set 6 seconds, after which it needs to be reactivated by breaking a combatant shield or critically wounding a target.
Deprecated the Frontal Assault melee ability, and the aftershocks and trample subclass node perks.
Sentinel
Sentinel Shield
Sentinel Shield damage vs. minor and elite combatants increased by 12.5%.
Warlock
Stormcaller
Stormtrance
Now has Ionic Blink and Landfall as default behaviors.
Landfall seeker damage reduced from 250 to 150.
Note: While the seekers added to bottom tree Stormcaller in Season of the Lost were a lot of fun, they made Stormtrance more of a shutdown Super than we're comfortable with. Given that it is also a solid roaming option and now has increased base mobility with Ionic Blink, we felt we could reduce the seekers damage.
Stormtrance no longer increases its attack upkeep cost when targeting multiple enemies at once.
Note: We believe that Stormtrance's greatest strength should be clearing hordes of enemies, and the increased cost based on target count was running counter to that intended role.
Stormtrance damage vs. minor and elite combatants increased by 20%.
Chain Lightning
While amplified, Chain Lightning now creates two sets of chains, up from one, jumping between more targets.
Now also jolts your primary target.
Lunge range increased from 4.5m to 5.25m.
Ball Lightning
While amplified, Ball Lightning now detonates two additional times, for a total of three vertical damaging strikes.
Increased arming shape length below the projectile by 2 meters to resolve some edge cases where targets that the detonation area could potentially damage were not triggering the projectile to detonate.
Arc Souls
Being or becoming amplified now also amplifies your Arc Souls, granting them a greatly increased fire rate.
Damage per projectile increased from 25 to 35 vs. PvE combatants.
Amplified Arc Souls projectiles per burst decreased from 6 to 5, fire rate decreased by ~10%.
Note: We expect to see significantly increased uptime on supercharged Arc Souls, so we wanted to provide a bit more time between bursts where players could safely engage an enemy that has an Arc Soul in PvP activities. We hope the increased PVE damage offsets this change sufficiently, but we'll be keeping an eye on it going forward.
Deprecated the Rising Storm melee ability, along with the Transcendence, Pulsewave, and Arc Web subclass node perks.

General
Blink
Maximum displacement distance increased from 4.5m to 5.25m.
Maximum vertical offset (how high up or down you are displaced based on your aim angle from the horizon) increased from 2m to 2.5m.
Increased forgiveness of mantling to ledges after exiting Blink.
Energy model reworked:
Previously, Blink charges recharged slowly one-by-one, and could be activated at a cadence that felt inconsistent and often left players confused as to how many charges they had available.
Now, Blink has a consistent activation cost. You can carry two charges at once, and 2.2 seconds after activating your last Blink, both are immediately recharged. We've also added a screen wipe and sound effect when this occurs, similar to Icarus Dash, to help communicate when you're ready to Blink again. The overall availability of Blink is similar to the previous version, but we hope it is more understandable and results in fewer instances of frustration from the energy recharge model.
Note: These changes apply to Blink on all subclasses that have access to it.
Blind
Screen shader brightness has been significantly decreased to address photosensitivity issues from the previous fully whited-out version.
Ionic Traces
No longer provide Super energy on pickup.
Reduced melee, grenade, and class ability energy return to compensate for expected increased uptime:

Base class ability energy return reduced from 25% to 15%.

Now amplifies you in addition to granting an Arc Soul when consuming your grenade.
Platform and Systems

General
Fixed an issue where text chat messages persist after being kicked out to the login screen without exiting the game.
Glimmer pickups will now play dematerialization VFX when picked up.

Multiple key bindings for vehicles have missing or incorrect definitions.

Global Changes
Fixed an issue introduced in the 30th Anniversary update that caused too much Heavy ammo to drop when running double Special weapons
Several weapon stats were previously hidden, which made fully evaluating weapons difficult.
Airborne effectiveness, recoil direction, zoom, and aim assist are now visible on the weapon inspection screen.
Armor
Increased the vibrancy of the glow colors in the "Candescent Prism" Solstice ornament sets in order to bring them back to parity with Update 4.1.5.
This also fixed shaders not correctly applying to these sets.

Fixed an issue where the Antaeus Wards was not changing its glow color based on the Guardian's current subclass.
Weapons
Stasis Rocket Launchers and Stasis Grenade Launchers with the perks Chain Reaction, Dragonfly, and Cluster Bombs will now have cool Stasis-themed VFX and audio.

Fixed an issue where One for All would grant more bonus damage than intended on Grenade Launchers.
Fixed an issue where using Shoot to Loot with Enhanced Overflow would overflow the weapon much more than intended.

Arc Subclasses
Reworked to fit the Subclass 3.0 system. There are too many individual systemic changes to list here, but the Arc subclasses now use the Aspect and Fragment system used by Stasis, Void, and Solar.
Standardized a set of buffs and debuffs aligned to the Arc damage type:
Amplified - Your movement speed and weapon handling are greatly increased. After sprinting for a short time, you enter Speed Booster, further increasing your sprint speed and granting damage resistance against PvE combatants.
By default, rapidly defeating multiple targets with Arc damage will amplify you. Your equipped Aspects and Fragments provide additional methods to become and benefit from being amplified.
Ionic Trace - A bolt of pure Arc energy that travels along the ground, seeking its creator. When picked up, Ionic Traces grant grenade, melee, and class ability energy.
Blind - Combatants are disoriented and cannot fire their weapons. Enemy players' HUD is removed and their vision is obscured.
Jolted - The target is energized with destructive Arc Light. As they take additional damage while jolted, they chain lightning to nearby enemies. This chain lightning can occur multiple times while a target is jolted.
Hovering over Aspects, Fragments, or abilities on the Arc subclass screen now displays a tooltip flyout detailing any relevant status effects.
Some old subclass perks have been deprecated, while others have been rolled into base ability behavior, Fragments, or Aspects with some changes to behavior as a result.
All classes now have access to all Arc grenades.

Arc Staff
Now has both Whirlwind Guard block capability and Lightning Reflexes armored dodge as default behavior.
Arc Staff damage vs. minor and elite combatants increased by 12.5%.
New Super added: Gathering Storm
Hurl your Arc Staff forward, embedding it into surfaces or large targets, dealing damage to and jolting nearby targets. After a short time, a devastating lightning bolt strikes the staff, overcharging it with Arc energy. While overcharged, your staff discharges lightning at nearby foes.
New jump added: Blink
Arc Hunters have recovered from a not-so-brief case of amnesia causing them to forget how to Blink.
Disorienting Blow
Now applies a short blind to nearby targets rather than a generic disorient, and also amplifies you on hit.

Increased travel distance from 18m to 22m.

While using Arc Staff, your next attack strikes twice after dodging.
Deprecated the Ebb and Flow subclass node perk.

The Stability weapon stat now grants flinch resistance in addition to its other effects, with a maximum flinch resistance of 10% to 25% depending on the weapon archetype.
For a complete breakdown, check out our massive novel-length TWAB from a previous week here.
For the full changes made to how airborne gameplay works, please check out the full breakdown here. For a brief recap:
All Primary weapons have their airborne accuracy penalty removed (i.e., they're just as accurate airborne as grounded—your bullets go where you're aiming).
We've added a new weapon stat called airborne effectiveness, which has been deliberately tuned on all Exotic weapons, everything that shipped in Season 16, and everything from Season 17 onwards.
Some outliers also have a hand-tuned stat, like the rest of the Trials of Osiris and Nightfall weapons.
All other weapons have a default value, set per weapon archetype.
Precision angle threshold - 0 at 0 stat, high at 100 stat.
This controls how easy it is to get headshots while airborne. If this is 0, you must pinpoint aim exactly at the head to get the headshot, otherwise you'll get a body shot even if your aim assist cone overlaps with the head.
What this means overall is that players will get fewer misses due to randomness from the accuracy cone while airborne, but reliance on aiming is much higher at low stat. In order to make this easier, players will need to build into airborne.
The airborne effectiveness stat comes from three sources:
Weapon:
The weapon's base airborne effectiveness stat, with ranges varying from 0 to 10 and to 0 to 30, depending on the weapon archetype.
Exotic weapons typically get a higher stat than Legendary weapons in that archetype.
This is available to weapon perks, starting with Air Assault.
Subclass:
The Heat Rises Warlock Solar Aspect: +70 while Heat Rises is active (i.e., on consuming your grenade).
The Tempered Metal Solar Fragment: +20.
The Whisper of Hedrons Stasis Fragment: +20.
Exotic Armor:
Exotic armor that revolves around being airborne, or works on specific weapons, grants a bonus or penalty that is usually in the -50 to +40 range.
Stompees: -50.
Lion Rampant: +100, only while hip-firing.
Peacekeepers: +40 on SMGs only.
Celestial Nighthawk: +100, only for firing the Celestial Nighthawk Super shot.
Lucky Pants: +20, on Hand Cannons only.
Peregrine Greaves: +10.
Wings of Sacred Dawn: +50.
Nezarec's Sin: +20, with Void weapons only.
Necrotic Grips: +20 with Weapons of Sorrow (and similar weapons).
This means that, in general, if you want good airborne effectiveness (i.e., 80 stat), you should pick a weapon with a high stat, put Icarus Grip on it, and either equip an Exotic armor piece that helps, or run a subclass Aspect or Fragment.
If you want the best possible airborne effectiveness, you'll generally have to go all in on all three: weapon, Exotic armor, and subclass.
This is a big weapon system change; we'll be monitoring how it rolls out and adjusting as needed.
Playlist weapons (Gambit, Crucible, and strike drops) now have a chance to roll with extra traits in one or both columns, increasing with number of rank resets with that vendor.
Starting in Season 17, all playlist weapons from Beyond Light and later will drop with the appropriate Origin Trait.
Archetypes

Sniper Rifle:
Reduced stow, ready, and aim-down-sights times by 10%, i.e., all Snipers are now snappier.

Reduced damage falloff start and end by 1m.
Reduced aim assist and magnetism falloff start and end by 2m.

0 stability: unchanged at 0.750.

Adaptive: 0.660s, 270 damage.
Rapid-Fire: 0.500s, 245 damage.
Auto Rifle:

Pulse Rifle:
Increased damage falloff near distance based on the range stat:
0 range: increased from 15 to 16m.
100 range: increased from 22.5 to 24m.
(Note that this is the hip-fire falloff distance and is multiplied by the zoom value to get the aim down sights falloff distance).
Damage falloff far distance remains 40m regardless of the range stat.
Increased Lightweight (450RPM) Pulse Rifle damage per bullet from 15 to 16 (with a 1.65x precision scalar this will increase precision damage from 24.75 to 26.4).
This won't change the optimal time to kill (TTK) in PvP but will reduce the number of crits required.
Submachine Gun (SMG):
Increased damage falloff near distance by 1.5m.
Adjusted zoom values on most viable Legendary SMGs and one Exotic.
Shayura's Wrath: 17 ? 16.

At 0 stat: increased from 30 to 60 m/s.
At 100 stat: increased from 80 to 100 m/s.
Rocket Launcher:
Fixed rocket damage scalar by ROF so it applies to impact and detonation damage and increased the difference from 5% to 10%.
Reduced the Eyes of Tomorrow damage map buff from 1.3x to 1.2x since it gets 1.1x from this Rocket Launcher change (no other Exotic Rocket Launcher should be affected).

All Exotics that shipped before the Forsaken expansion release now have their kill trackers visible by default.
Fighting Lion:
Reverted the Season 15 breech Grenade Launcher blast radius reduction, but just for Fighting Lion, by increasing blast radius by 0.4m.
Increased damage by 5%.
Eyes of Tomorrow:
Increased damage vs bosses and Champions by 30%.
Leviathan's Breath:
The Archer's Tempo perk from the catalyst now has increased effect (just on this weapon).
The standard draw time scalar for Archer's Tempo is 0.75x, it is now 0.5625x on Leviathan's Breath.
Added a small delay before detonation on Champions, mini-bosses, and bosses.
This allows the impact to stun an Unstoppable Champion and the detonation to deal bonus damage against the stunned Champion.
Damage changed to be more of an even split between impact and detonation, and increased damage across the board by ~50%.
Overall damage vs Champions are roughly doubled (even more compared to shooting an un-stunned unstoppable Champion).
The Huckleberry:
Increased zoom stat from 13 to 15.
Xenophage:
Reverted the Season 15 change (which reduced the rate of fire to 100RPM).
Increased rate of fire from 100RPM to 120RPM.
Reduced damage per bullet to match the previous.
Doesn't benefit from the Season 15 or Season 17 Machin Gun PvE damage buffs.

Solar Subclasses:
Reworked to fit the Subclass 3.0 system, in particular: Solar subclasses now use the Aspect and Fragment system used by Stasis and Void.
Standardized a set of buffs and debuffs aligned to the Solar damage type used across your subclass, weapons, and armor:
Cure - You are healed in a burst of mending Solar Light.
Restoration - You continuously regenerate health and shields over time. Cannot be interrupted by taking damage.
Radiant - Your weapons are enhanced by the power of the Traveler and deal increased damage to foes.
Scorch - The target is singed by destructive Solar Light, taking damage over time. Scorch damage increases as the target accumulates more Scorch stacks. After 100 Scorch stacks are applied to the target, they Ignite.
Ignite - A large, damaging Solar explosion in an area around the target.
Hovering over Aspects, Fragments, or abilities on the Solar subclass screen now displays a tooltip flyout detailing any relevant status effects.
Some old subclass perks have been deprecated, while others have been rolled into base ability behavior, Fragments or Aspects will have fluid behavior because of that.
All classes now have access to all Solar grenades.
Grenades

Healing Grenade (NEW):
Releases a wave of benevolent Solar Light on impact with targets or the environment that Cures allies and creates a blessing that grants Restoration on pickup. Tracks to allies in its flight path.
Solar Grenade:
Now applies 20 Scorch stacks to targets on initial detonation and 14 Scorch stacks per second to targets in the lingering damage volume instead of a generic Solar burn effect.
Base cooldown increased from 105s to 121s.
Tripmine Grenade:
Now applies 40 Scorch stacks to targets caught in the blast.
Firebolt Grenade:
Now applies 20 Scorch stacks to targets hit by secondary seekers.
Fusion Grenade:
Now applies 40 Scorch stacks targets caught in the blast.
Incendiary Grenade:

Thermite Grenade:
Now applies 10 Scorch stacks to targets hit by each wave.
Swarm Grenade:
Now applies 5 Scorch stacks to targets caught in each drone's detonation.
Hunter

Gunslinger
Split Golden Gun into two separate variants, Deadshot and Marksman:
Deadshot (6-shot variant):
Now deals increased damage while Radiant.
Now refunds a Golden Gun round when you cause a target to Ignite while your Super is active, rather than on any kill.
Marksman (3-shot variant):
Now deals increased damage while Radiant.
Now over-penetrates targets by default.
Blade Barrage:
Increased consistency of tracking strength.
Knives can now track targets more predictably at very close and very far ranges.
Increased PVE damage vs. PVE combatants by 25%.
Knife Trick:
Now applies 20 Scorch stacks per knife rather than a generic Solar burn effect.
Weighted Throwing Knife:
Now refunds your class ability on precision kill rather than itself.
Now causes Scorched targets to Ignite on hit.
Lightweight Knife (new melee):
A quick Throwing Knife option that deals moderate damage and causes you to become Radiant when you land a precision hit.
Acrobat's Dodge (new ability):
Perform an acrobatic leap, driving a Solar knife to the ground. On landing, you and nearby allies are made Radiant.
Deprecated the Practice Makes Perfect subclass node perk.
Reworked the Knock 'Em Down subclass node perk:
Now passively grants additional bonuses to your Solar Supers:
Marksman Golden Gun has 15% additional damage resistance and 4 seconds increased duration (+33%).
Deadshot Golden Gun has 4 seconds increased duration (+33%).
Blade Barrage now fires 5 additional knives per wave (+70%).
In addition, Radiant-defeating targets with your equipped Throwing Knife refunds your melee energy.
Nightstalker
Trapper's Ambush:
Landing detonation now counts as melee damage and will trigger perks like Echo of Exchange and Melee Wellmaker.
Stylish Executioner:
After a Stylish Execution, your weakening melee attack now also deals bonus damage to targets.
Arcstrider:
Fixed an issue where Tempest Strike would sometimes fail to travel through doors with low ceilings.
Titan

Sunbreaker
Hammer of Sol:
Now shatters into explosive secondary projectiles as default behavior.
Burning Maul:
Increased initial light attack lunge distance.
After landing ten light attack hits, now automatically spawns a Heavy attack cyclone at the target's location.
Hammer Strike:
No longer weakens targets.
Now applies 40 Scorch stacks to the primary target hit by Hammer Strike and deals damage to targets behind them. If the primary target is killed by a Hammer Strike direct impact, they automatically Ignite.
Throwing Hammer:
Now applies Cure (in addition to refunding the melee cost) when picked up if the Hammer struck a target.
Deprecated the Mortar Blast melee ability and the Explosive Pyre and Tempered Metal subclass node perks.
Roaring Flames:

Damage scalar reduced to compensate for expected increased uptime:
Now 20% increased ability damage to combatants per stack, down from 30%.
Note: melee damage bonus is reduced when Peregrine Greaves, One-Two Punch, Wormgod Caress, or Synthoceps' perks are also active.
Now ~13% increased ability damage to players per stack, down from 25%.

Sunspots are now created from Solar ability kills, kills on Scorched targets, or Hammer of Sol impacts.
Sunspots now apply Scorch (in addition to dealing damage) to targets that pass through.
Sunspots no longer provide an outgoing damage boost, but now grant Restoration when you pass through a Sunspot you created.
Grenade and melee regeneration bonus scalar granted by Sol Invictus (previously Sun Warrior) reduced from 3 to 1.5.
In general, we want significant amounts of ability regeneration to come from buildcrafting rather than any single source, and the amount of bonus energy granted by Sun Warrior didn't meet our goals in the new system where additional buildcrafting elements are present.
Sentinel
Offensive Bulwark:
Increased the amount of time added to your Void Overshield's duration when you defeat a target with a melee attack.
Now 6 seconds bonus duration, up from 2 seconds.
Behemoth
Diamond Lance:
Fixed an issue where the Diamond Lance pickup interactable would delete itself if an enemy player walked through it.
Warlock

General

Note: this change was also previously applied to the Titan Barricade ability with the launch of The Witch Queen.
Dawnblade
Daybreak:
Now sends out a streak of flames on impact as default behavior.

Solar-Focused Exotic Armor Updates

Young Ahamkara's Spine:
No longer grants ability energy from burn damage ticks.
General

Void Invisibility:
Radar ping loop now begins after 5 seconds of invisibility, up from 3.
With Update 4.0.0.4, we made a change to radar behavior for invisible targets. We believe that this was the right path forward, but our tuning was slightly too aggressive and removed space in the Nightstalker kit that allowed them to intelligently flank bunkered players.
The changes in this update mean that base Vanishing Step or Trapper's Ambush melee invisibility will not trigger a second radar ping (unless the invisible player begins sprinting or uses their vertical movement mode). With one source of invisibility extension (like Echo of Persistence or Graviton Forfeit) active or with an extended invisibility effect (like a Trapper's Ambush Quickfall or Stylish Executioner activation), one additional radar ping will occur, and if two extensions are used then two additional radar pings will occur.
Void Volatile:
Fixed an issue where volatile detonations could be applied to a single target immediately rather than going on the intended 1-second cooldown.
We don't believe this will result in a noticeable player-facing difference in volatile behavior or efficacy outside of edge cases with Volatile Rounds or Controlled Demolition but will be keeping an eye on this going forward.
Lowered the amount of physics acceleration applied to targets by volatile detonations.
Resilience:
Now grants increased incoming flinch resistance and damage resistance vs. PVE combatants.
Power and Progression

Power Bands have been increased for the new Season:
Power Floor: 1350 (unchanged)
Soft Cap: 1510 (up from 1500)
Powerful Cap: 1560 (up from 1550)
Hard Cap: 1570 (up from 1560)
The Character Power Boost has been increased to 1510 with the new Soft Cap.
Bounties and Pursuits

Fixed an error granting unintended progress for Weapon Flair Triumph.
Activity streaks for Crucible, Vanguard, Xûr's Strange Favor, and Gambit no longer reset when you enter a non-ritual activity. Instead, they rebalance themselves every time you complete a ritual activity, so you can never have a total of more the 5 across the 4 reputations.
Players no longer receive Gunsmith reputation for completing campaign missions.
Public events objectives now award participation for all types of public events.
Fixed an issue where The Butler RS/2 Rocket Launcher is rewarded to a new Guardian after starting the New Light campaign a second time.
Fixed several issues affecting the runes in the Veles Labyrinth Lost Sector in the Cosmodrome.
Removed bounty related objectives from Gambit, Crucible, and strike intro quests.
Fixed an issue where new characters would start with other subclasses unlocked when deleting a veteran character.
Vendor buttons leading to abilities now show a checkmark to signify all abilities have been acquired from subclass tree.
Rewards

Dares of Eternity: Increased Strange Coins earned from the reward chest in Dares of Eternity from 1 to 3. This does not affect the number of Strange Coins earned from Lightning Round chests.
Dares of Eternity: Fixed an issue that could result in the Pinnacle reward for completing the weekly activity challenge to result in duplicates more often than intended.
Seasonal Challenges with unique items or upgrades now show those rewards with large icons. Experience and Bright Dust continue to use smaller icons.
Season Pass

Going forward, Catalyst Quest Boosts acquirable from the Season Pass will apply to all active Season Pass Exotic catalyst quests. This applies to Season of the Risen and after.
A Season Pass exclusive Ghost projection has been added to the premium track (available at rank 45).
Some existing rewards were moved/consolidated to accommodate this change but no items have been removed from the Pass.
Vendors

Xûr's inventory should no longer be different if players manage to find him at destinations shortly after the weekly reset happens on Tuesday. He will still reappear with new gifts from the Nine when he returns at his regularly scheduled time on Friday.
Updated the names and descriptions for some vendor engrams. Engram items titled "Gear" should directly reward you with an item of that type, while engrams items titled "Engram" should reward you with a decryptable engram you can bring to Rahool or focus at a vendor.
Platforms and Systems
Cleaned up Audio settings for voice chat on non-PC platforms:
Voice Settings: Remove console voice chat settings for Blended, Headset Only, Speakers Only.
Improved the consistency with which PlayStation and Xbox platform rosters update the online status of platform friends.

Added failsafe to all carry objects in the ritual and boss phases so that they respawn in a reachable location if they are never picked up for 30 seconds. This should unblock the activity if they somehow spawn or fall out of bounds.

Dev note: Funny enough, this is the biproduct of something we've been working on over the last season to improve Adept drop rates post-flawless, as well as help the Flawless pool feel more rewarding... which leads us to the next patch note!
Once players have gone flawless in a given week, they now have a chance of earning Adept Weapon drops on any Trials Ticket that has earned 7 or more wins while the Flawless Pool is active, regardless of loss counts.

Seals

Fixed an issue where the Moments of Triumph 2021 title could not be equipped.
Gameplay
Weapons

Fixed an issue where the Explosive Personality Grenade Launcher was not using the correct RPM stat for wave frames.
Note that the crafting screen will still display the wrong RPM which will be fixed in a future patch.
The actual weapon item will have the correct stat.
Fixed an issue where The Logic ornament for The Lament appeared backwards.

Fixed an issue where the previous reduction of melee recharge rate for Graviton Forfeit was erroneously applying in PvE activities.
Fixed an issue where the Exotic Titan Helmet, Loreley Splendor, would consume class ability energy upon death without spawning a Sunspot(as in the case of taking enough damage to fully deplete your health while you still have any shields).
Players must first acquire Vow of the Disciple raid mods before they can be applied to armor from that raid.
Fixed an issue where some armor was not appearing on the Appearance Customization screen, even after it had been unlocked with Synthweave.

Abilities

Boss combatants no longer take additional melee damage while frozen by Stasis.
Sentinel Titan's Bastion barricade now takes 20% increased damage from player sources.
This damage bonus stacks with other sources of anti-emplacement damage like the Hakke Breach Armaments origin trait or Anti-Barrier Rounds.
Targets with Void invisibility active now ping the radar for 0.6 seconds every 3 seconds until invisibility ends. Normal radar visibility rules still apply (i.e., double jumping or sprinting pings the radar).
Note: Now that we've seen feedback and data from the first weekend of Trials in Season 16, we wanted to take a few steps to address a few outliers in the Void 3.0 subclass kits.
These changes are targeted specifically at PvP and don't affect the PvE sandbox.
We believe that some frustration stems from prevalence and will taper off over time as additional subclasses are brought into the 3.0 system, but wanted to address what we can before the next Trials weekend.
As always, we'll be on the lookout for feedback and will adjust where needed.
Fixed an issue where Child of the Old Gods could damage some targets through immunity shields.
While the Child will not be put on time out, it now knows better and has issued heartfelt apologies to all targets that it has damaged through immunity.
We are thankful to have such a good Child, and are proud of them.

Gameplay and Investment
Armor
Six new permanent armor mods have been added to the game: Kinetic Siphon, Harmonic Siphon, and an equivalent mod for each of the four damage types.
These mods can be socketed into your helmet mod sockets and allow your weapons to generate Orbs of Power (functionality that has been deprecated from weapons).
These mods are automatically unlocked for all players, and work with all weapons of the appropriate damage type.
A suite of permanent armor mods has been added that work with the new Glaive weapon archetype: Glaive Ammo Finder, Glaive Targeting, Glaive Loader, Glaive Dexterity, Glaive Capacity, Unflinching Glaive, Glaive Ammo Scavenger, and Glaive Holster. These mods can be obtained when opening Legendary engrams.
Reduced the cost of changing the energy type of a fully Masterworked piece of armor.
Once Masterworked, Legendary armor can swap between energy types for a cost of 10,000 Glimmer and an Upgrade Module.
Fully Masterworked Exotic armor can swap between energy types for a cost of 20,000 Glimmer and an Upgrade Module.
Fixed an issue where Titans could accidentally trigger the Energy Converter mod while in their Super, consuming all stacks of Charged with Light for no gain.
Fixed an issue where higher-tier damage reduction could be extended when gaining lower-tier damage reduction.
Protective Light's damage reduction reduced to 10 percent.
Well of Tenacity damage reduction increased to 50 percent.
Dev Note: Protective Light was previously too dominant and felt too much like a must-take mod. By swapping the damage reduction values of Protective Light and Well of Tenacity, Protective Light should no longer feel like a mandatory part of every loadout, and players will need to choose between a smaller, but longer-lasting, amount of damage reduction on-demand when wounded (Protective Light) vs. a shorter-duration but stronger amount of damage reduction when picking up Void wells (Well of Tenacity).
Reworked Heart of Inmost Light to be more consistent and readable.
Fixed an issue where Titans who threw Sentinel Shield would lose Charged with Light stacks to recharge abilities that could not recharge mid-Super.
Synthoceps no longer increase the damage of Stasis Crystals while in Super.
Finisher mod rework
Finishers can now always be performed even when using mods that require Super energy.
If the required Super energy is not available, the benefit will not trigger.
Dev Note: With the introduction of Lucent Hive Ghosts and finishers being mechanically necessary to defeat them, the finisher mods have all been updated to behave differently. Now, regardless of which mods you have equipped or how much Super energy you have, you will always be able to perform finishers. If you don't have the requisite energy, or you don't need what the mod would grant, the benefit will not trigger, and you will not have Super energy deducted. For example, if you have the One-Two finisher equipped and you have a full melee and/or less than one-sixth of your Super energy, you will be able to perform the finisher, but you will neither gain melee energy nor be charged Super energy.
Weapons
Fixed an issue where the Zealot's Reward Fusion Rifle could be fired without costing the correct amount of ammo.
Bows with Explosive Head and the Anti-Barrier mod will now detonate on impact with enemies.
Fixed an issue where the Whisper of the Worm ornament, Roar of the Wyrm, had slightly visible holes near the scope.
Global
Kill Trackers
Now visible by default on all weapons that shipped in Forsaken and later.
Exotic weapons from earlier than that will be updated in a later release.
Special Ammo

Players now only drop one Special ammo on death (or equivalent), no matter how much they were carrying (as long they weren't empty).
The maximum you can pick up off a Special brick is one for a Shotgun, Fusion Rifle or Sniper Rifle, or equivalent for other weapons.
Scavenger adds to this as normal.
Quickswap Glitch

Fixed an animation cancel allowing players to use a specific button combination to swap almost instantly.
Inserting mods on Legendary weapons is now free and instantaneous.

Dead Man's Tale

Reduced the catalyst's hip-fire rate of fire from 150 RPM to 130 RPM.
Lorentz Driver and Arbalest

Doubled the amount of flinch received.

Perks
Hip-fire Grip

Now increases damage falloff start and end distances by 20 percent (except on Shotgun, Sniper Rifle and Fusion Rifle).
Adagio

Increased duration from 5s to 7s.
Increased damage bonus (except for on Bow and Fusion Rifle) from 25 percent to 30 percent.
Now adds +10 range.
Added a timer to the buff text to make it easier to tell when it's going to expire.

Reduced self-damage scalar for Grenade Launchers. Combined with the other scalars, this ends up reducing self-damage from 1.25x to 0.75x.

On Fusion Rifles only:

Abilities
Void Subclasses

Reworked to fit Subclass 3.0 system. There are too many individual systemic changes to list here, but the Void subclasses now use the Aspect and Fragment system used by Stasis.
Standardized a set of buffs and debuffs aligned to the Void damage type:

Added an energy barrier to the Scavenger's Den Lost Sector on EDZ, when playing on Legend or Master difficulty, to prevent skipping most of the encounters in the Lost Sector. This Lost Sector will enter active rotation again in a future season.
STRIKES
The Corrupted:
To reduce the overall length of the strike and make it less painful after hard wipes in the elevator encounter, we have removed the Taken combatants in the dark Ascendant Plane hallway leading up to the elevator.
If a fireteam hard wipes during the final phase of the boss fight in the Ascendant Realm, when they respawn, the portal to the Ascendant Realm will take them straight to Phase 2, instead of making them replay the platforming section between Phase 1 and Phase 2.
When a fireteam arrives at the platforming area before the boss fight in The Adytum, any fireteam members or Ghosts left behind in earlier parts of the strike will now be teleported forward to join their fireteam.
When players begin the elevator encounter, any straggler players or their Ghosts will be pulled forward to join their fireteam.
Fixed an issue where Sedia's shields would regenerate faster than expected on Nightfall difficulties. Her shields now regenerate based on health threshold in Nightfalls, just like they do in Direct Launch or the Vanguard playlist.
The portal to the Ascendant Realm after Phase 1 of the boss fight should now reliably place players facing the correct direction.
Fixed an issue that was preventing the combatants from walking to part of the right-side area during the first half of the boss-fight. Psions should now spread out a little bit more on that right platform.
Fixed an issue where a Taken Acolyte would spawn within the floating platform area before the boss fight, and immediately fall to its death before ever really getting to live.
Fixed an issue where, in certain conditions, the relic would despawn and never respawn during the boss phase.
Fixed a cosmetic issue where the relic spawners during the boss phase would spin before the relic was spawned.
The Inverted Spire:
Fixed an issue where a player's Ghost would appear too far back in the strike upon death near the drill area. The Ghosts now appear at set safe locations in the drill area.
The Scarlet Keep:
Fixed an issue where the crystal to continue the strike would be permanently invincible if players got to the wizard at the first stop of the elevator and killed it before the crystal could spawn.
Strikes: Fixed an issue where the catchup version of Grandmaster Hollowed Lair had different modifiers than the weekly featured version.
FREEROAM

Destroyed.

Combat
Weapons
Hand Cannons
Aggressive
Increased Rate of Fire (RoF) from 110 to 120.
Broke out Aggressive Hand Cannons, allowing custom tuning of stats (e.g. damage falloff for 100 range in this subfamily now starts at 32m).
Adaptive and Precision
Range stat now has more impact on minimum damage falloff range for both archetypes.
Damage falloff for 100 range now starts at 25m, was 20m.
Precision Hand Cannon
180 RoF magazine scaled up by 37 percent.
Note: This also affects Exotics with that RoF.
Lightweight (folded in to Adaptive)
Moved all Lightweight Hand Cannons (150 RoF) to the Adaptive subfamily (140 RoF).
This includes Luna's Howl and Not Forgotten.
One Exotic Hand Cannon will retain 150 RoF.
We aren't going to leave it to speculation.
It's beautiful.
It does Solar damage.
It makes enemies explode.
It's Sunshot.
Sniper Rifles
Adjusted how aim assist (AA) is affected by Sniper Rifle Zoom rating. The lower the Zoom the lower the AA and vice versa. Scopes with around 50 Zoom are unchanged.
Lowest-Zoom scopes have a large reduction in AA cone angle.
Highest-Zoom scopes have a small increase.
Auto Rifles
Adaptive
Damage per bullet reduced from 15.75 to 14.25.
Note: Prior to Season of the Worthy, damage per bullet was 13.75.
Scout Rifles
Increased how much each point of the AA stat widens the AA cone.
At maximum, the AA cone is now 15 percent wider.
Rocket Launchers
Increased reserves by 1 or 2 rockets depending on Inventory stat.
Perks
Outlaw - Reload speed increase felt insufficient with certain subfamilies and combinations of rolls (e.g. Aggressive Hand Cannons).
Increased Reload stat bonus from +50 to +70.
Merciless
Increased Inventory stat from 36 to 55 (this increases reserve ammo).
Mountaintop
Reduced splash damage by 33 percent, increased impact damage such that total damage is 5 percent lower than before.
Reduced projectile velocity multiplier from the Micro-Missile perk from 1.4 to 1.2. (i.e., now 20 percent faster than other breech Grenade Launchers instead of 40 percent).
Reduced in-air accuracy. Now has significant projectile error while in-air (around 7 degrees without the Icarus Grip mod, substantially less with).
Falling Guillotine
Reduced Heavy Attack damage by ~24 percent to bring in line with other Swords.
Note: Falling Guillotine will continue to be slightly above average, just not to the extent that it is now.
MIDA Multi-Tool and MIDA Mini-Tool
MIDA Mini-Tool
Moved the "Mida Synergy" trait to the intrinsic, similar to how the (Baroque) version works.
Added the following perks:
Hip-Fire Grip
Kill Clip
NOTE: There is an issue with the Masterwork on this weapon that prevents it from being upgraded. This will be fixed in a later update.
NOTE: The Gunsmith will begin selling a version of this weapon on November 10 with no infusion cap.

Drang
Moved the "Together Forever" trait to the intrinsic, similar to how the (Baroque) version works

Significantly reduced the damage of the drain effect on enemy combatants.
Arbalest

Armor Piercing Rounds swapped to High Caliber Rounds.
This fixes an issue that could prevent the Exotic perk from triggering.
Traveler's Chosen
Reduced muzzle flash intensity.
Point of the Stag
Increased Point of the Stag's Max Power Level to 1310.
Divinity
Fixed a bug that prevented some weapons from dealing precision damage to the Divinity cage (e.g. Eriana's Vow).
Energy Type Requirements
All of the weapon-oriented armor mods (e.g. Hand Cannon Loader, Fusion Rifle Ammo Finder, etc.) have been changed to be any energy type.
As a result of the above change, all Arc Charged with Light mods now activate their second perk if you have any other Arc mod equipped on the same armor piece, or if you have any other Arc Charged with Light mod socketed in any other armor piece you are wearing.
Enhanced Mod Rebalancing
All mods that have an Enhanced version of that mod (e.g. Enhanced Hand Cannon Loader) have had the base mods' efficacy increased to match that of the Enhanced version of the mod.
As a result, those Enhanced mods have been deprecated, and the base mods' energy costs have been adjusted upward slightly (but are still lower than the equivalent Enhanced mods).
Some mods have moved to different slots to create more competition for mod sockets across armor pieces (for example, the Fast Ready mods have moved to the Arms socket).
Raid Mods
Starting in Season of the Hunt, Last Wish, Garden of Salvation, and the upcoming Beyond Light raid armors will now drop with a fifth, dedicated armor mod socket that is exclusively for the mods related to that raid.
Anti-Taken mods from Last Wish will only function in the Last Wish raid.
Anti-Hive mods from the Leviathan raid will be deprecated.
Anti-Fallen raid mods from Scourge of the Past will be deprecated.
Last Wish and Garden of Salvation armor acquired prior to Season of the Hunt will not have this dedicated armor socket but will still be able to use the mods related to that raid in the new Legacy armor mod socket.
Combat Mods
All armor released in Beyond Light and Season of the Hunt, all Last Wish and Garden of Salvation armor acquired starting in Season of the Hunt, and all Armor 2.0 Exotic armor pieces (including those already possessed by players) will have a Combat style mod socket.
In Season of the Hunt, this socket will accept all Charged with Light and Warmind Cell mods.
All Armor 2.0 armor acquired during Seasons 8 through 11 have had their Seasonal mod sockets replaced with a single, unified Legacy mod socket that can socket all Charged with Light mods, all Warmind Cell mods, all Nightmare Hunt mods, all Garden of Salvation mods, and all Last Wish mods.
Banshee-44 now has a chance to sell armor mods from Black Armory, Season 10, and Season 11.
Anti-Champion Mods
Anti-barrier rounds will now penetrate Taken Phalanx shields.
All Anti-Champion mods have been shifted to armor, rather than taking a weapon mod slot.
Abilities
Increased Hunter's dodge cooldown by a few seconds
(E.g. Tier 4 original cooldown: 22 sec. New cooldown: 26 sec)
Orbs of Light have been changed to Orbs of Power as they can now be consumed by Light and Dark subclasses.

Created additional new user experience tutorials to help explain equipping weapons and armor, quests and bounties, lost sectors, strike matchmaking, and more.
Veterans can experience this new campaign should they choose by retrieving the "A Guardian Rises" pursuit from the Quest Archive.
The Pain & Gain Exotic quest for Riskrunner has been replaced
This quest has been folded into the New Light campaign experience.
Subclass Acquisition
New Light players who do not have a veteran account with all subclasses unlocked will now acquire alternate subclasses from Ikora

All subclass pursuits are class scoped just as their subclasses are.
Alternate characters with missing subclasses can acquire them by speaking with Ikora and accepting the subclass pursuit package.
Added a new vendor to the Tower, located to the left of the Postmaster.
The Quest Archive Vendor functions much like the Destiny 1 Abandoned Quests Kiosk as well as a way to acquire older pursuits.
The kiosk has subpages that group the pursuits just as they are seen on your Quests page.
Going forward any pursuits abandoned will go to this vendor.
Older pursuits can now also be found on this vendor.
This is to help ensure that vendors do not become overwhelmed by older content.
Triumphs are now unlocked as part of the New Light experience
Prior to this moment you will not be able to navigate Triumphs if your account has not yet unlocked them.
Unlocking Triumphs on any character enables them for all.

These pursuits can be acquired when returning to the Tower after your first strike.
They can be picked up, but they will not advertise on the vendor waypoint/tooltip until you've progressed through the game further.
Strikes can be unlocked after completing the first step of the strike introduction pursuit provided by Zavala.
The Forsaken campaign now has the same introduction behavior as Shadowkeep and Europa.
All players regardless of expansions owned get to experience the first mission of the Forsaken campaign upon unlocking the Tangled Shore.
Completing this activity is a requirement for unlocking Free Roam on the Tangled Shore.
Accounts that own Forsaken will automatically be given the remainder of the campaign and may continue as they see fit.
Accounts that do not own Forsaken will be able to pick up the remaining campaign for Forsaken from the Quest Archive vendor once they've purchased it.
Accounts that do not own Forsaken can still explore the Tangled Shore and the Dreaming City after having unlocked their patrol zones.
Beyond Light
Veteran characters who log in and qualify for the start of the Beyond Light campaign will be automatically launched into it.
New characters who log in and qualify for the start of the Beyond Light campaign, but have not completed the New Light quest, will not be automatically launched into it.
This does not disable a new character from manually starting the Beyond Light campaign.
Chaperone Acquisition
There is now an alternative pursuit for acquiring the Exotic Shotgun, Chaperone.
This pursuit may be acquired via Shaw Han on the Cosmodrome or the Quest Archive Vendor in the Tower.
This pursuits requires ownership of Beyond Light.

Reload Perk Changes
Design notes:
Reload stat: 0-100, and maps onto an archetype-specific reload animation speed.
Reload duration scale: most reload perks also apply a small multiplier to the reload animation, so that if the reload stat is capped, you still see a small speed bump (the same applies to some other perks, e.g. those that affect handling).
Reload empty duration scale: as above, but only applies if the magazine is empty.
Note that because most weapons have fairly high reload stats, dropping reload bonus from +100 to +50 will still cap the reload stat most of the time, resulting in an overall fairly small change to final speed (this still opens some design space however),
Outlaw
Reload stat from +100 to +50.
Reload duration scale from 0.8 to 0.9.
Feeding Frenzy
Functionality changed to give increased reload speed based on number of rapid kills (up to five stacks).
Max reload duration scale from 0.83 to 0.8 (i.e. a little faster than currently).
Max reload stat unchanged at +100.
Rapid Hit
Adjusted stack to stat mod curve to give less benefit for the first hit and more with subsequent hits.
Reload stat from +100 to +60.
Reload duration scale from 0.8 to 0.925.
Stability stat from +50 to +25.
Drop Mag
Reload duration scale from 0.85 to 0.9 (which just brings it in line with Outlaw).
Field Prep - unchanged, but for reference:
Reload stat +50
Reload duration scale 0.8
Alloy Mag - unchanged, but for reference:
Reload empty duration scale 0.6666

Other Perk Changes
Dynamic Sway Reduction
Adds 10 stability over time in addition to accuracy.
Pulse Monitor
Reload amount from 0.35 to 1.0.
+50 handling
5% faster swap speed (this will be most noticeable if the above caps handling stat).
This works on stowed weapons too, which was already the case but makes it a lot more useful.
Hipfire Grip
1.2x aim assist falloff.
+15 aim assist.
+1.7 degrees precision hip fire angle threshold.
By default, when hip-firing a weapon the center of your reticle must be over a target in order to get a crit, otherwise aim assist will give you a body shot. This change gives you a little leniency, so if the center of your reticle is not directly over a target you will still get the crit if you're within this angle.
Has no effect on Sniper Rifles.
Sneak Bow
Now doesn't ping radar when shooting.

General Archetype Changes
Slug Shotgun PvE Damage + 30%.
High-Impact Pulse Rifle damage per bullet from 21 to 22 - this changes it from six crits to five crits/one body to kill a guardian in PvP at most resiliences.
Bow PvE damage vs minors + 10%

Armor

The Powerful Friends armor mod will no longer stack. If multiple copies of this mod are equipped, the mods will provide no bonus stats.
Developer Commentary:
Only Solar Seasonal mods are intended to stack. No part of Arc mods are intended to have stacking functionality.
Powerful Friends granted +20 to Mobility, which players could leverage to get three stat columns to the max of 100 points. The mod is not priced sufficiently to justify its benefits, and increasing its cost would have adverse effects on its primary benefit usage.
Season 11 introduces a new Arc mod, granting a similar stat bonus to Strength and will not stack.
Enhanced Auto Rifle Loader, Enhance Fusion Rifle Loader, and Enhanced Bow Loader armor mods now have a chance to drop from pinnacle mod sources.
Addressed several mod visibility and source string issues in the Mods Collection screen.

Finishers
Finisher System added. Press the finisher button to finish critically wounded combatants.


PvE Damage Numbers Display
Goal: To provide players with useful and legible feedback for damage dealt to enemy combatants across many years of Power progression.
Displayed damage numbers for damage dealt to non-Guardian enemy combatants are crunched
Damage dealt is displayed using fewer digits to enhance readability of damage output
Occurrences of displayed damage getting capped at 999,999 should be significantly reduced or eliminated
The exponential curve used to calculate damage numbers for display is replaced with a new linear curve that is built to last for many years
As players grow in Power, displayed damage numbers increase at a much more measured pace than previously
This is a UI update only; player damage output, whether measured as hits to kill, time to kill, or DPS, remains unchanged by this update


PvE Difficulty Tuning
Goals: Widen the sweet spot where fighting higher-level combatants provides a fun, challenging, and rewarding combat experience for a more enjoyable Power climb. Also, allow players looking for even greater challenges to confront much higher-level enemies.
Combatants that are 10-40 levels higher take less time to kill and deal less damage
Higher-level combatants continue to increase in difficulty up to 100 Power levels above the player
When enemies are 100 Power levels or higher above the player, they are immune to damage
Nameplate icons on higher-level combatants have been updated to reflect these changes
These changes affect only higher-level combatants; the at-level or over-level experience remains unchanged
Sandbox
Abilities
Buffs

Nightstalker Way of the Pathfinder (Bottom)
Goal: We want to lean into the fantasy of a speedy disruptor. Pathfinders need more tools to scout the battlefield and a skill based way to engage with that gameplay more often. We should reward this scouting and battlefield control gameplay, executed well, with more opportunities to do the same. At the same time shadow shot needed some quality of life improvements for long standing frustrations.
Vanish: Smoke bomb grants invisibility to allies
Gives 1 stack of Heart of the Pack (newly revamped) to all allies hit
Grants +34 to armor, recovery, and agility
Gives weapon reload speed and handling
Max 3 stacks
Increased invisibility duration from 7 > 8 seconds

Provision: Killing tethered enemies creates super orbs and increases agility, armor, and recovery for allies
New Perk (old perk benefits moved to be part of Mobius Quiver)
Damaging enemies with your grenades reduces the cooldown of your smoke bomb (6% per damage tick)
Making allies invis gives you grenade energy (17.5% per ally)


Moebius Quiver: Fire super multiple times and deals massive damage to tethered targets
Added the old Provision perk to naturally be part of Mobius Quiver
Killing tethered enemies creates super orbs and grants stacks of Heart of the Pack for allies
Expanded the range of Heart of the Pack from 20 > 30 meters.


Shadowshot Super (Top and Bottom path)
Damage increased from 150 > 250
One shot kill in PvP
Improved tether accuracy near obstacles
Suppress on hit is more consistent


Sentinel Code of the Protector (Top)
Goal: This path is the main support role for Titans and focuses heavily on melee kills while staying near allies. We want to focus more heavily on buffing allies so that players care about the timing of their buff usage. With a loop which allows players to get their melee energy back more quickly this will be a more engaging path to play. Additionally, Ward of Dawn is currently not up to snuff, and needs a buff that ties in to the fantasy of buffing allies.
Defensive Strike: Melee ability that creates an overshield for nearby allies
All kills while the overshield is active grant melee energy for the player with the shield (works for all allies you grant a shield to)
This is based upon enemy threat level from 5% (minors) to 25% (players and bosses)

Rallying Force: Melee kills heal nearby allies
Heal buffed from 10 health and 10 shields to 10 health and 20 shields (50% increase)

Ward of Dawn: Alternate super that creates a shield bubble
Increase ward health versus supers 
Most supers will require the whole thing to be dumped on the ward to destroy it but will (usually) not kill the players inside
Ward grants weapons of light buff when passing through it (35% weapon damage for 15 seconds)
Grants an additional super orb (3)
Auto-generated orbs now grant the same amount of super energy as regular super orbs (previously the orbs gave less super energy on par with masterwork orbs)

Sentinel Code of the Aggressor (Bottom)
Shield Bash: Shoulder charge that disorients nearby enemies
Now suppresses the target hit and any enemy within 2 meters (have to be basically right next to them)


Voidwalker Attunement of Hunger (Bottom)
Vortex: Nova Bomb leaves behind a damaging AoE pool
Initial explosion damage increased 15%
Lingering damage increased 15%


Dawnblade Attunement of Grace
Well of Radiance: Alternate super that creates a healing/buffing field for allies
Grants an additional super orb (3)
Auto-generated orbs now grant the same amount of super energy as regular super orbs (previously the orbs gave less super energy on par with masterwork orbs)
Nerfs

Nightstalker Way of the Trapper (Top)
Shadowshot: Fires an arrow that damages enemies and debuffs enemies nearby
Damage sharing for the Nightstalker player specifically reduced from 100% to 50%
Now all allied players have 50% damage sharing on tether


Nightstalker Way of the Wraith (Middle)
Flawless Execution: Headshot kills while crouched grant invisibility and truesight
Truesight now lasts 3 seconds (down from 9)


Shattering Strike: After performing a Flawless Execution, your melee attacks have a longer lunge range and weaken enemies
Advanced warning: When we made the change to Flawless Execution this also unintentionally nerfed this ability to only last 3 seconds (it was directly tied to the truesight). We have prepared a fix for the 4.6.1 patch to restore the weaken and lunge range increase to last the entire 9 seconds regardless of truesight and invisibility status.


Instant Reloading
Goal: In the beginning, Lunafactions and Rally Barricade did exist, but they were clunky to use. They still had dramatic impact on gameplay even in that state, but eventually we decided to make their effects easier to handle. The problems they introduced always existed in the game, but over time these have become magnified due to new abilities, perks, and weapons introduced into the Destiny 2 sandbox. The impact of something that takes all reloading out of the equation means that other perks or effects like the Hunter's Marksman Dodge or the Sealed Ahamkara's Grasps can simply fall to the wayside - Even swords take a hit in comparison, being one of the few weapons that naturally never needs to reload.

Reloading is one of those mechanics that are simple, but have wide ranging consequences. Because the effect on gameplay of removing reloading is inversely proportional to the size of your weapon's magazine and how slow your general reload animations are, weapons like Rocket Launchers and Shotguns can benefit greatly compared to other weapons. This, alongside the increase in general access to damage bonus effects like Well of Radiance left us with the decision to remove this effect from these two sources, as they were causing things to quickly snowball out of control.

Titan Rally Barricade
This ability now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of the effect
This ability no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserves


Warlock Rift/Well of Radiance
Lunafaction Boots now provides a large increase to reload speed for the duration of Well of Radiance
This exotic no longer automatically reloads your weapons from reserves


Super Energy Regeneration
Goal: These changes will reduce the speed with which players are able to earn their super which supports difficulty and reduces the current ability to trivialize certain content through excessively chaining supers. Systemically, we want to reduce base sources of supers on a large macro scale without diminishing the feeling that your actions are gaining you a worthwhile energy boost. By reducing the speed at which you gain super we can make mods and perks feel more worthwhile. We still want it to feel like you can make meaningful progress not only through normal play but by augmenting super energy through teamwork, class choices, gear, and skillful play.

New Energy Granted by Super Orbs:
Super Orb: 7.143% (50% reduction)
Masterwork Orb: 2.5% (50% reduction)
Kills: (25% reduction)
Minor: 0.6%
Elite: 0.96%
Mini-boss: 1.8%
Boss: 3%
Player: 3%
Assists: (25% reduction)
Minor: 0.3%
Elite: 0.48%
Mini-boss: 0.9%
Boss: 1.5%
Player: 1.5%


Damage Multipliers
Goal: At ;Destiny 2 launch, damage buffs were fairly sparse - There was Empowering Rift for a small increase, and you could combine it with a weakening effect such as Hammer Strike, but very little else. As time has gone on, we introduced Well of Radiance, Weapons of Light, Guiding Flame, Frontal Assault, etc, and combining these effects has resulted in player damage output far beyond what was previously available. Even with just a small amount of them, a player can go from 1x damage to 3x and beyond, causing there to be an extremely large gap between standard player output and theoretical output.

By preventing the larger effects from stacking, we are able to keep each of them around without having to do something in response like raise boss health to compensate for these tactics, as well as create more of them. As an example, Lumina would not have been created in world where the damage bonus effect of Noble Rounds stacked with other damage effects, and these changes are simply an extension along those same lines.

While the weakening effects never stacked, we also took a look at them and adjusted their values as many of our more powerful units would simply evaporate when touched by one of them, but we compensated for that in other ways, such as either extending the duration of the effect or in the case of Shadowshot, making it affect power weapons.

Player Damage Buffs
Player Bonuses
Bonus damage effects that apply to all of a player's weapons simultaneously no longer stack multiplicatively. The highest applicable bonus will be used instead
This does not affect single weapon buffs such as Rampage, Kill Clip, or exotic weapons that increase their own damage. These will still stack multiplicatively.
Buffs that provide bonus damage will still exist simultaneously on the player, so in the event that the one with the highest multiplier wears off the next highest will be used instead.
This change affects the following weapons/abilities (Empowering Rift, Frontal Assault, Guiding Flame, Sun Warrior, Inertia Override, Well of Radiance, Lumina/Noble Rounds, Weapons of Light)
Notable exceptions: Vengeance (One Eyed Mask)
Frontal Assault
Bonus damage is now +20% (Previously +25%)
Sun Warrior
Bonus damage is now +20% (Previously +25%)
Well of Radiance
Bonus damage is now +25% (Previously +35%)
Weapons of Light
Bonus damage is now +35% (Previously +25%)

Incoming PvP damage is now +50% for all elements (Previously +33%/50% for Non-Void/Void damage respectively)
Hammer Strike
Incoming PvE damage is now +30% (Previously +50%)
Duration increased from 6 to 10 seconds in PvE
Shattering Strike
Incoming PvE damage is now +30% (Previously +50%)
Duration increased from 6 to 10 seconds in PvE


Reduced Super Damage Resistance
Goal: Since the launch of Destiny 2 we have slowly introduced buffs to supers, especially roaming supers. While we believe supers should be powerful they should not be mindless. We want supers to be more risky in both PvE and PvP. We want players to think about positioning and timing more. Not so long ago we experimented with Spectral Blades by lowering the damage resistance substantially. These changes were generally well received and improved the experience of the super for both the person running it and the person who was running from it. In PvE players shouldn't feel like their super makes them invulnerable and casting one should call for situational strategic thinking. In PvP players need to feel like they can challenge a super and that with skillful play there's a chance they can beat it.

Super Damage Resistance removed from masterwork armor
Inherent Super Damage Resistance lowered by category (see below)


Low- 54% → 49%

Sealed Ahamkara Grasps perk Nightmare Fuel will now correctly reload weapons when used in tandem with Knife Trick and the Tractor Cannon
A Titan's Burning Maul line attack will no longer be blocked and detonate early if they have Telesto projectiles attached to them

The Enhanced Momentum Transfer perk now displays the correct icon

The Warlock's Arc subclass ability 'Pulsewave' buff will no longer clear the Quickdraw perk bonus granted from a weapon upon its expiration
The Warlock's 'Alchemical Etchings' perk buffs from Lunafaction Boots will now correctly be removed if/when their Well of Radiance is destroyed
Khepri's Sting will no longer consume the owner's melee ability energy charge when hit by a friendly Hunter's smoke bomb
Weapon Changes
Weapon mods are now treated as reusable unlocks instead of consumables. Any mods you have in your inventory will be converted to unlocks
This gives players the opportunity to play with different mods more frequently
If the only copy of a mod you have is already in a gun, you will need to reacquire one to unlock it
Minor enemies (Rank-and-File) no longer take more precision damage than other enemies
These enemies previously took twice as much damage to their precision hit locations than enemies of higher ranks
You will still deal precision damage, but this is now entirely dependent on the weapon, as it is for higher ranked enemies
The amount of time allowed between kills to generate a masterwork orb has been reworked per archetype:
2.5 seconds for shotguns, hand cannons, scout rifles, machine guns, and pulse rifles
3 seconds for auto rifles and trace rifles
4 seconds for bows, fusion rifles, rocket launchers, and grenade launchers
5 seconds for sniper rifles, linear fusion rifles, sidearms, submachine guns, and swords
Auto Rifles
PvE damage increased between +30% and +25% depending on combatant rank
Bows
PvE damage increased by +31% against minor enemies, and +26% against major enemies
Fixed an issue where bow draw times were displayed incorrectly in the inspection screen
Hand Cannons
PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 30%
Lightweight and Adaptive hand cannons use a new firing animation while aiming down sights
This change was made to increase weapon accuracy when firing these weapons as fast as possible
Ex: Currently, players can shoot faster than the recoil animation of 140/150 archetypes - so while the Hand Cannon looks to have fully reset from recoil, the following projectile will be shot as if the weapon was still in a recoiled state
Reduced the effect the range stat has on damage range falloff (effective range) for this weapon archetype
Machine Guns
PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 25%
Increased the effects of damage range falloff on this weapon archetype
Pulse Rifles
PvE damage against minor enemies increased by 28%
Increased the effects of damage range falloff on this weapon archetype
Archetype specific damage changes (impacts both PvE and PvP gameplay)
Rapid-Fire Pulse Rifles now deal 14/23.8 base/precision damage (Previously 13/21.4)
High Impact Pulse Rifles now deal 21/33.6 base/precision damage (Previously 20/32)
Scout Rifles
PvE damage increased between +36% and +18% depending on combatant rank
Sidearms
PvE damage increased to minor and major combatants by 16%
Sniper Rifles
PvE damage increased by +47% against minor enemies, +20% for others
Exotic sniper rifle perk damage bonuses have been modified to compensate for this change and they will not receive the full benefits as a result
Submachineguns
PvE damage increased by 22.5% against minor/major combatants
Aggressive Frame
Removed the intrinsic effect of "Deals bonus damage at close range."
This bonus was 10%, but was unintentionally always active
The bonus damage has been moved to the base damage for 750 RPM Submachineguns, resulting in no damage change
As a result, Tarrabah and The Huckleberry gain 10% damage in both PvE and PvP
Exotics
Sweet Business
Increased magazine size from 100 to 150.
Increased PvE damage by 15%.
High Caliber rounds have been replaced with Armor Piercing rounds.
Damage changed to 15/21.2 base/precision (Previously 13.21/21.14)
This weapon no longer requires you to be firing when you pick up ammo to have it automatically reload.
Graviton Lance
PvE damage increased by 30%
Sunshot
Increased magazine size to 12
Vigilance Wing
PvE damage increased by 25%
Crimson
Damage changed to 19/30.5 base/precision (Previously 13.76/24.75)
Fixed an issue that was causing this weapon to deal higher flinch than intended
Merciless
Fixed the missing aim assist stat for this weapon
Ace of Spades
Memento Mori's damage bonus is now affected by range falloff
Lumina
Noble Rounds should apply their buff to allies more reliably now
The Colony
"Serve the Colony" now functions as Auto Loading Holster does


Perks
Reduced the effectiveness of the following perks in PvE: (Added missing note 10/1)
Rampage, Kill Clip, Swashbuckler, Multi-Kill Clip, Desperado, Surrounded, Master of Arms, Onslaught
In general, these perks use the same damage multipliers for PvE that they did in PvP
The change to Rampage does not affect The Huckleberry
Onslaught and Desperado now change bullet impact values while active in PvE
Surrounded no longer multiplies precision damage on top of base damage, as it was benefiting some weapon types more than others as a result
Subsistence
Reduced the impact of this perk on total reserves
Ricochet Rounds
Removed the hidden bonus to damage falloff
Swashbuckler
Perk now activates when getting a kill with Ball Lightning
Grave Robber
Perk now activates when getting a kill with ranged melee abilities (ie: Ball Lightning, Explosive Knife)
One-Two Punch
Reduced the effectiveness of stacking One-Two Punch and Cross Counter (Liar's Handshake)
Ex: Players won't be able to defeat Riven in less than three seconds after Shadowkeep launches using the combo of One-Two Punch and Liar's Handshake, but we know many of you will try other builds... and potentially even succeed.


Weapon General Fixes
Fixed an issue where AI combatants in Gambit based activities were using PvP values instead of PvE values
Fixed an issue on Jade Rabbit where parts of the ornament were appearing on the original weapon art
Fixed an issue where masterworked weapons would sometimes spawn a large amount of orbs off a single kill
Fixed an issue where killing Vex Harpies with precision damage from Outbreak Perfected wasn't spawning Nanites as expected
Added missing Thunderlord Killfeed and Obituary icons
Infusing Thunderlord now correctly requires a destination material (EDZ Dusklight Shards)
Player Identity Systems
Triumph Steps
Triumphs can now be broken into steps with each step granting Triumph score
Some Triumphs have been extended with additional steps that grant additional Triumph Score
Some Triumphs have had their existing requirements broken into steps and the original Triumph Score has been split between those steps
Seasonal Artifact
Each season there will a new pursuit, the seasonal artifact
For Season of the Undying it is The Gate Lords Eye
At the end of the season the artifact will go away, and be replaced by a new artifact
The seasonal artifact has two progressions:
Artifact Power:
Gain an uncapped bonus to your power by earning XP.  Each point of power takes more XP to earn than the last
Artifact Mods
Earn up to 12 points by gaining XP
Spend points to unlock seasonal mods for Armor 2.0
Armor Changes
Character Stats
Discipline, Intellect, and Strength stats return from the original Destiny game
Your Discipline determines your grenade recharge rate
Your Intellect determines you super recharge rate
Your Strength determines your melee ability recharge rate
All stats now go from 0 to 100
For Discipline, Intellect, and Strength, a stat of 30 is the equivalent recharge rate to the pre-Shadowkeep recharge rate with no mods affecting that recharge rate applied
A stat of 100 is the equivalent of having 5 of the appropriate recharge rate-affecting mod applied
Each piece of armor now provides you with contributions to each of your six stats
Armor that drops in the world, from engrams, and activity rewards have randomized stats


Armor 2.0
All exotic and legendary armor will drop to use the new armor system
Armor 2.0 versions of exotic armor pieces can be pulled from your Collection provided you have collected that exotic
All Armor 2.0 armor pieces have an energy type (Arc, Solar, Void) and an energy capacity
Energy capacity can be upgraded by spending currencies and materials, to a maximum of 10
Armor with 10 energy is considered to be masterworked and provides a +2 bonus to all six character stats
All armor mods have an energy cost and an energy type (Arc, Solar, Void, or Any)
Arc, Solar, and Void mods can only be socketed into armor of the matching energy type; mods with an Any energy cost can be socketed into any armor
Each piece of armor comes with multiple armor mod sockets, into which your mods can be applied
A socketed armor mod occupies an amount of the armor's energy capacity equal to the mod's energy cost; you must have enough armor energy available to be able to socket a mod
Armor mods are no longer consumable, and are instead unlocked and resuable across all applicable armor pieces once acquired
Armor mods can be acquired from gunsmith packages, direct purchase from the gunsmith, world engrams, and pinnacle activity engrams
Armor 2.0 mods and pre-Armor 2.0 armor perks do not stack


Masterworks
Fully masterworked armor no longer provide bonus damage reduction when using your super


Exotics

Titan
Actium War Rig
Now works with heavy machine guns
Warlock
Lunafaction Boots
Removed the effect of automatically reloading allies' weapons while they occupy your rift
This exotic armor piece now grants a reload speed bonus for allies occupying your rifts
Economy
Armor Masterworking Costs
Masterworking Armor costs and levels have been updated to include two new materials: Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards
Both these materials can be obtained via the following sources:
Nightfall: The Ordeal rewards
Purchased from the Gunsmith for a rotating variety of currency and resources
Other special reward sources such as the Season Pass
Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards are capped at 50 and 10 respectively to limit hoarding, and to keep players unfamiliar with this system from sinking all their resources into a single item
Infusion Material Costs
Infusion between two items of any rarity now requires only a single material to complete: Upgrade Modules
Upgrade Modules can be obtained via the following sources:
Each of the Gunsmith Weekly Bounties award one Upgrade Module per week
Purchased from the Gunsmith for a rotating variety of currency and resources 
Season of Undying free track Season Pass rank rewards
Upgrade Modules are capped at 25 to limit hoarding, and to keep players unfamiliar with this system from sinking all their resources into a single item
Discarding an Enhancement Core no longer deletes the entire stack
Bright Dust
Bright Dust is now earned by completing Crucible, Gambit, and Vanguard weekly and repeatable bounties
We chose to grant all of Bright Dust from ritual weekly bounties rather than spreading it out across the weekly and daily bounties so players could more easily earn Bright Dust without having to make sure they complete every single daily
Players will be able to do the repeatable bounties as many times as they like
Any Crucible, Gambit, or Vanguard completed bounties need to be turned in before maintenance begins on 9/30 as these changes will reset them; other bounties—Gunsmith, clan, Eververse, etc.—can still be claimed after Oct 1
Eververse items no longer dismantle into Bright Dust, and instead grant legendary shards and glimmer
New Eververse items for Season of the Undying will become available for Bright Dust two weeks into the Season
Eververse items no longer require Bright Dust to reacquire them(or re-roll perks) from Collections; instead, they cost the same materials that reward items of the same type/rarity use
Fireteam Medallions have been removed from the store, deprecated into Fizzled Fireteam Medallions, and can now be dismantled into Bright Dust to recover their purchase price (50 Bright Dust)
Gleaming Boon of the Vanguard price has been lowered to 150 Bright Dust
Gleaming Boon of the Crucible price has been lowered to 500 Bright Dust
Eververse
The Season 7 Best of Year One Engram has been retired, and in its place, players can now obtain the new Season 8 Nostalgic Engram
The Seasonal Milestone no longer grants a bounty; instead, it directly grants a Bright Engram
The Season 8 Nostalgic Engram is no longer earned at level up
Instead, the Bright Engram is now included in the free rewards of the Season Pass that are visible before level 100; it's also awarded every 5 levels after level 100
The Eververse storefront is now available via the Director
Eververse bounties (standard and IGR versions) have been deprecated; any remaining bounty notes can be broken down into Bright Dust
You can still complete and turn in any outstanding Eververse bounties until they expire 
Glimmer
Players can now store up to 250,000 Glimmer
Glimmer rewards from the majority of sources in the game have been rebalanced
Most open world sources (public events, Lost Sectors, chests) have been significantly increased
Passive Glimmer gain on kill has been reduced
In addition to directly awarding Glimmer on kill, combatants will sometimes drop additional Glimmer chunks
Weekly bounties award a large amount of Glimmer in addition to their other rewards

Spider's Exchange
The Spider welcomes new opportunities with four arms open and now deals in materials from all planets
However, the Spider has noted changes in market value, and has adjusted his exchange rates accordingly:
Glimmer exchange now costs 10 Legendary Shards or 20 materials, and yields 10,000 Glimmer
Tangled Shore daily bounties no longer award Glimmer, providing instead Etheric Spirals (in keeping with his competition)
Weekly wanted bounties no longer award gear, but now provide between 3,000 and 15,000 Glimmer in addition to the Enhancement Cores currently offered
Xûr
Xûr's inventory pool and Fated Engram now include world-drop Exotics from Year 2
Universal Ornaments
Select armor sets now function as Universal Ornaments. Once unlocked, these ornaments can be used to change the appearance of any Legendary Armor 2.0 item. Note armor items that correspond to converted Universal Ornaments have not been removed from player inventories; already owned armor items still exist in their current state.
All previously purchased Eververse armor pieces will unlock a corresponding Universal Ornament of the same appearance and slot on all Armor 2.0 items
Past Eververse sets have been converted to Universal Ornaments, and will be available in Silver bundles via the Eververse archive 
Pricing for these bundles will be reduced for each piece in the bundled set already owned on the account
Seasons 1 and 3 sets will be available when Shadowkeep launches - additional seasonal sets will be added at later dates
Gunsmith
Weekly bounties now award an Upgrade Module instead of an Enhancement Core
Banshee-44's mod inventory has been refreshed
Banshee-44 is now selling Upgrade Modules for infusion, as well as Enhancement Prisms and Ascendant Shards for armor Masterworking
Players who obtained a Legendary set of Solstice armor in Season of Opulence will find a bundle available on Banshee containing an Armor 2.0 version of the set
You must be logged in on the relevant class to see its bundle on Banshee (if you obtained that class's Legendary Solstice set)
Rewards Power and Progression
All non-powerful rewards now drop 3 to 0 points below your highest equippable Power level, up from 15 to 20 below
Year 2 powerful reward sources have changed to Legendary rewards
These sources no longer have a chance to drop a random Exotic instead of the Legendary gear
Bonus Exotics that drop from Nightfall: The Ordeal will drop at the character's highest equippable Power level
Under- and over-leveling activities no longer adjust how much Power is received from the rewards
Experience no longer fuels a player's character level, which has been changed to be level 50 for all characters
Experience instead progresses the Season Pass, Seasonal Artifact mod, and Power progressions, as well as the unlocking of destinations for new characters
Experience rewards have been rebalanced with the introduction of the Season Pass and Seasonal Artifact progressions
The Power granted from the Seasonal Artifact is additive with the Power of the player's equippable gear, but does not increase the Power of gear drops
All existing gear has had its Power increased to a minimum of 750; new characters will begin Destiny 2 at Power 750 as well
The Power bands for Season 8 are as follows
Floor: 750
Soft Cap: 900
All drops up to this point will be upgrades to the most powerful item in your inventory or vault
Beyond this point, only powerful and pinnacle rewards will increase a player's Power
Powerful Cap: 950
All non-powerful/pinnacle rewards are capped at 950
Pinnacle rewards are the only way to raise Power above this point
Powerful rewards are equivalent to the character's highest-equippable Power beyond this point
Pinnacle Cap: 960
This is the highest Power at which gear drops; also known as the "hard cap"
The Seasonal Artifact bonus Power allows characters to attain values above this level
Prime Engrams
Prime Engrams now gain charges more quickly, drop more frequently, and have a higher maximum charge cap (nine charges, up from six during Year 2)
The Power gains have been rebalanced for the increased frequency, providing +3 Power, down from a range of +4 to +7
Players who have completed the "Prime Example" quest prior to Shadowkeep's release will earn charges, but those charges won't drop until the character has reached 900 Power
This will help players avoid spending charges early for gains that are most beneficial during the Soft Cap to Powerful Cap range
Bounties
Reworked Tower bounty pools, and added a new 'Repeatable Daily Bounty' which can be purchased by players for a significant amount of glimmer as many times as they like
Activities
Vanguard
Added new activity on the Vanguard screen - Nightfall: The Ordeal

New characters can acquire the classic campaign pursuits from Amanda Holliday
If the player acquires a campaign pursuit for a mission on a planet they have not yet unlocked by earning XP, that planet will become unlocked
For example, if the player has only unlocked the EDZ and Titan, and then they acquire the Curse of Osiris campaign pursuit, the Mercury destination will become unlocked
New characters have immediate access to all playlist activities (but they still might not meet the Power requirements for higher tiers of Player Elected Difficulty, or they might need a special item like a Mote Synthesizer to play the Reckoning)
New character will be granted the New Light main quest. This quest will lead them through most ritual activities, Year 1 seasonal content, and Year 1 destinations
For new characters, Zavala, Shaxx, and Drifter will initially have simplified inventories. Players must complete a short intro quest for Strikes, Crucible, and Gambit to unlock the full inventory of bounties and pursuits on these vendors

Dev Commentary: These changes apply to hipfire only, and do not impact accuracy. The goal of this change was to enhance the feeling of shooting an SMG. We've added a random fire pose that will add variation and make the gun feel a little more unstable and lively in your hands. We've also added a progressive fire animation that will give your Guardian a feeling of gripping and controlling the more active weapon during sustained fire.

Activities
Gambit

Activities hosted by the Drifter have been moved to their own sub-page on the Director called "Gambit"
Added Gambit Private matches for all Forsaken owners
Expect Gambit Prime Private matches on April 2, 2019
Overhauled how invader spawn points are chosen while also significantly increasing the number of invader spawn points for each map
Chances of spawning very near or in direct line of sight of an enemy Guardian has been greatly reduced
Changed the third round of Gambit to a Primeval rush sudden death; this will speed up Gambit matches overall and add a change of pace to the final round
The Primeval is immediately summoned
Player Supers/grenades/ability/melee are immediately filled, so both teams are on an even playing field
Super/grenade/ability/melee regen are increased for the remainder of the round
The Ascendant Primeval Servitor's (meatball) spawn rate is no longer tied to the curse cycle and has been greatly increased
Idle Protection: Players who remain dormant for too long will not receive end-of-match rewards or Infamy points
Made adjustments to Blocker types by deposit tier
Small Blocker = Taken Goblin with less health than the previous Phalanx
Medium Blocker = Taken Captain with more health than the previous Knight
Large Blocker = Taken Knight with more health than the previous Ogre
Gambit Matchmaking

Teams are now always broken up when re-entering the matchmaking pool after a match
Previously, when a match ended, players who did not return to orbit would be sent back to the matchmaking pool together; this is no longer the case
This will greatly reduce the likelihood of re-matching against the same players and will give matchmaking an opportunity to find the best possible match
Infamy

Players can now earn Infamy points by completing Gambit Prime matches and bounties
Increased the Infamy point rewards for Gambit matches by 25 points
Gambit HUD 

The HUD status bars now animate when returning from aim-down-sights
The Invader Portal Ready icon and animation on the status bar has been updated to be more pronounced and understandable at a glance
Triumphs and Medals

"Light vs. Light" can now be progressed by killing any Guardian (not just invaders) using a Super; this makes attaining Dredgen a less daunting task

Blade Barrage Super
Impact damage decreased from 150 to 35

Now deals self-damage
Our goal for AoE supers of this type is that they incur self-damage when activated too close to a target. We consider Blade Barrage not causing self-damage a bug, which we are now addressing.
In other words, Hunters will know how Warlocks feel when they throw a Nova Bomb into a wall.

Raiden Flux (Exotic Armor)

Bows
Made the effect of draw time from bow string perks more noticeable (High Tension String, Flexible String, Elastic String, and Polymer String)
The accuracy stat from High Tension String was increased from 10 to 15 to better compensate for the slower draw time

Fixed an issue where players could not purchase the Annual Pass from the Director node


Destiny 2 Update 2.1.1.1
Sandbox
General

Chaos Reach
Tuned Chaos Reach's deactivation cost so that it consistently retains Super energy from deactivating early.
Previously, Chaos Reach allowed Players to save Super energy when deactivating the Super early by charging a flat Super energy cost upon deactivation (~65%). This meant that in order to save Super energy, you'd have to deactivate within the first second or so of the Super's duration.
With this change, Chaos Reach's deactivation will now always save you some Super energy. Deactivating the Super is no longer a flat energy cost but, rather, now works on a curve. The intention is to reward players for skillfully timing their deactivation.

Activities
Crucible

Breakthrough
Decreased attacker respawn time from 7 seconds to 5 seconds after the Breaker is deployed
Modified the game rules to prevent teams from forcing the round into a stalemate:
In the initial fight over the Breaker, the team with the most capture progress (high-water mark) will win the Breaker if time runs out without any Breaker progress present. There will still be overtime if time runs out with progress present, and the Breaker will go to the team with current progress at the end of 30 seconds, or to the high-water mark if progress reaches zero with no players on the Breaker.
While a team is hacking the other team's Vault, progress decay accelerates gradually during Sudden Death for up to 30 seconds, after which the round will end the moment no attackers are present in the capture zone.
If the round ends in a draw twice, the match ends in a tie.
Neither team will get Glory points from this scenario.
Win Streaks are maintained.

Exotic Duplicate Weighting

When a player receives an Exotic, we now take into account all Exotics the player has found and weight them against Exotics they have yet to acquire. This lowers the player's chances of receiving Exotics they already own.

When receiving duplicate Exotics, the player is more likely to earn armor pieces as these have randomly rolled perks

Year 1 armor will always dismantle to one Masterwork Core
Year 1 weapons can dismantle to one or two cores, but no longer three

If you complete an activity while severely under-leveled,  rewards will offer a larger Power upgrade

Destiny Weapon Tuning - Rise of Iron
From the desk of Greg Peng.

With every new Destiny expansion, we find an opportunity to try to holistically address Sandbox balance. We learn from our success and mistakes, scrutinize player activity from our vast reserves of player data, and come up with a plan of execution. With an expansion, we can change the balance landscape not only by modifying old guns, but also by creating new ones to fill missing roles and satisfy player desires.

The changes in 2.4.0 will go hand in hand with the weapon ecosystem of Rise of Iron.

Exotics
Fabian Strategy
Doubling down on a Titan's role to hold the front line, Fabian Strategy users will now be able to hold down the trigger to melt enemies until there are none left.

Kills with this weapon now automatically load a portion of the magazine
Increased base range (+16%) and stability (+44%)
Thorn
Since we are bringing back Thorn for Rise of Iron, it was worth re-evaluating its place in the weapon ecosystem. What are Thorn's strengths? 

Damage over time (which provides location information and health recovery delay)
Fastest family of Hand Cannon fire rate
Effectively best in class level range with Send It
To avoid a repeat of year one, we decided to remove one of those elements from the equation.

Reduced base range by 25%
Universal Remote
An exotic shotgun not gated by the special ammo economy was already a dangerous tool, but as players honed their mastery over the strong mobility options that Destiny has to offer, a hair-pulling combination was born. A range reduction helps bring the efficacy of these sorts of tactics down a bit.

Exotic Perk range bonus reduced by 75% (no longer guarantees maximum shotgun range)
Increased rate of fire (lowers damage as a secondary effect)
Dreg's Promise
Fitting in with the retune of Sidearms (see below), Dreg's gets a little bit more love. 

Increased damage by 8%
Increased magazine size by 3
Touch of Malice
It is intended that Touch of Malice still shine best in King's Fall, but outside of the Raid, clever players figured out how to avoid Touch of Malice's single drawback by imbuing themselves with the Blessing of Light - but the Darkness has been boiling stronger within the gun...

Touch of Malice's self-damage infliction now removes Blessing of Light
Boolean Gemini
This super versatile weapon receives another tool in its kit.

Added intrinsic perk High Caliber Rounds
No Time to Explain
I'm going to respect the spirit of the weapon with this one.

Added intrinsic perk Headseeker
Sniper Rifles
Snipers are being utilized extremely effectively in both the Crucible and against the Minions of the Darkness. However, one family of Sniper Rifle stands out from the rest - the mid-high impact family of sniper rifles (of which 1000-Yard Stare and Y-09 Longbow Synthesis belong).

Let us evaluate the benefits of the family:

Decent magazine sizes combined with strong impact provide for strong DPS
Strong target acquisition and when combined with Hidden Hand can reach the upper echelon normally reserved for lower impact Sniper Rifles (Weyloran's March)
Ability to take down a guardian while in their super state
High body-shot damage with a rate of fire still fast enough that the two tap body-shot is still viable
The resulting Sniper Rifle has all the strengths of other families but without the drawbacks. To spread the power a bit, we touched two elements:

Reduced damage on the mid-high impact (1000-Yard Stare family) of Sniper Rifles by 6.95%
Mid High impact snipers can no longer reliably kill high armor guardians in super
No Land Beyond is not affected by this damage reduction
Reduced Target Acquisition for LDR 5001/Y-09 Longbow Synthesis to bring in line with other snipers in the same family
As a result, the slowest firing family of Sniper Rifle (Black Spindle) should be your key tool to take down Supers, balanced by lower magazine size, fire rate, and aim assist.

Aim Deflection (aka Flinch)
"You get the drop on an enemy sniper, reducing him down to a pixel of his life. Right before you pull the trigger for the last bullet to exit your scout rifle's chamber, you see the glint and hear the sound of your head turning to mush. You raise your fist in the air and release a silent scream so as not to wake the baby."

With these changes, we want to give your primary weapon a better chance at contesting sniper rifles. 

Increased the starting strength for aim deflection (aka Flinch) when players take damage while scoped in from 30% starting to 50% starting
With every subsequent hit, the strength of deflection increases until you hit 100% max deflection
Overall Sniper ADS aim deflection multiplier increased to 1.9x (was 1.85x)
Bugs

Fixed an issue where Eirene UI stat bars showed an incorrect rate of fire
Auto Rifles
With new Auto Rifles being introduced in Rise of Iron, playtests revealed a decrease in the importance of reloading - high rate of fire Auto users had enough bullets for multiple encounters. We do not want players feeling starved for ammo, but creating an opening for opponents to attack is an important part of the "combat dance" for Destiny.

Middle rate of fire Autos also received a small damage boost to help with damage falloff, but the resultant damage does not drastically change its time to kill.

Reduced the maximum magazine size for highest rate of fire Auto Rifle family (all weapons in the Doctrine of Passing family)
Increased damage to middle rate of fire Autos (1.5%)
Shotguns
While strong against combatants, fast firing Shotguns have generally experienced low up time in PvP. The following changes are meant to sweeten the value proposition, starting with everyone's favorite Titan class weapon.

Immobius: decreased spread on Titan class shotgun in ADS (0.1 zoom factor increase), increased base stability by 60%
Reduced spread angle penalty on Shotguns with the perk Full Auto, Invective was not affected
Increased high rate of fire and middle-low rate of fire shotgun damages by 2%
Pulse Rifles
With high rate of fire Pulse Rifles being strong contenders in the crucible, we put our lens on the mid and low rate of fire models, nudging them slightly forward while still maintaining Pulses around the three burst kill.

Increased rate of fire for the Hakke Pulse Rifle Lyudmila-D
Minor increase (2%) to damage for middle rate of fire family Pulse Rifles (Nirwen's Mercy)
Sidearms
When evaluating player loadout data across the game, we can see that Sidearms are being underutilized. With 2.4.0 we aim to change that, pushing Sidearms to shoot further, faster, and more predictability. 

Unified damage for all Sidearm types
Increased damage for existing Häkke Sidearm families by 3% for lowest rate of fire and 7% for higher rate of fire
Decreased damage for non-hitscan Sidearms by 5% for Vestian Dynasty and Queen's Choice
Minor extension of damage falloff point for Sidearms across the board (+0.5 meters)
Minor increase of stability for Sidearms across the board
Added damage bonus in PvE (20-30% dependent on combatant tier)
To accommodate two new faster firing Sidearm families releasing in Rise of Iron, all current Sidearm rate of fire bars will be slightly shorter
This is so we have more bar space to display rate of fire differentiation
Does not change the actual fire rate, just the stat bar representation
Rocket Launchers
While super satisfying, Cluster Bombs are not always super reliable. At times, the bombs land inches out of their effective range and hit for single point damages.

Grenades and Horseshoes is by and far the most popular Rocket Launcher perk. While decreasing the chance that a rocket misses, it also removes or reduces many of the interesting combat prediction elements that make the weapon archetype interesting to play.

By making Cluster Bomb more reliable and Grenades and Horseshoes less effective, we hope to mix up the Rocket Launcher perk selection and inject a bit more technique into the archetype.

Increased effective range on the explosions for the Cluster Bomb perk
Grenades and Horseshoes perk activation radius reduced (1.3->1 meters)
Truth is not affected by this change
Machine Guns
The high rate of fire family of Machine Gun really hits the fantasy when it comes to face melting crowd control weapons. Increasing their DPS will also help them shine in other scenarios as well (i.e. boss battles). 

Increased damage on highest rate of fire Machine Guns (4%)
Hand Cannons
You will only find small bug fixes for 2.4.0 for this weapon category. However, as a preview to Rise of Iron, newly minted low rate of fire hand cannons have a higher maximum possible range stat, giving players a distinct reason to choose that type of weapon.

Fixed an issue where the hand cannon Zaouli's Bane's rate of Fire stat would display incorrectly
Fixed an issue where the Taken King Vanguard and Armsday Hand Cannons (Down and Doubt 00-0, Kumakatok HC4) stats would display incorrectly.
Fusion Rifles
Again, only small bug fixes. You can stop making that joke now.

Accelerated coils correctly reflects damage reduction now on the UI stat bars
No change to gameplay effect, UI only
Fixed an issue where stat bars on Techeun Rage displayed incorrectly
Perks
After months of collecting player feedback and analyzing usage data, we decided upon a list of perks that could benefit from a refresh. We also decided to reduce the effectiveness of Unflinching, which otherwise would have negated the aforementioned sniper flinch changes without tradeoff. Finally, classic magazine perks like Armor Piercing Rounds now give additional range bonuses.

Take a Knee

Now activates after 0.5 seconds of crouching
Added flinch reduction (25%) and increased aim down sights speed by 25%
Exhumed

Added an extra +5 seconds (15 seconds total) of effect time
Cascade

Functional change: melee kills automatically reload a portion of the magazine
Surplus

Now increases carried ammo capacity
Grave Robber

Increased activation chance to 25% (from 20%)
Guerilla Fighter

Increased stability and range bonuses by 200% (think of it as a bonus Hammer Forged and Perfect Balance when the perk activates)
Magazine Perks

Magazine perks now give range bonuses
Removed impact stat bonuses that had no effect on base damage and only on the UI
Armor Piercing Rounds: adds +4 range, reduces -4 handling
High Caliber Rounds: adds +3 range, reduces -5 handling,
Skip Rounds: adds +5 range, reduces -3 handling, adds +5 inventory
Unflinching

Decreased efficacy of the perk from 25% flinch reduction to 15% flinch reduction
As a final note, sometimes there are bugs that require a more careful roll-out than can be achieved through a small update. The stakes are much higher when the issues lie deep within the foundation of the Destiny engine. This bug has been an incredibly difficult one to fix and test - we hope that we got it this time.

Firefly

Possible fix for crash related to special effects triggered by the Firefly perk
That's all for 2.4.0 Weapons Update Preview. I hope it's been informative, and I'm looking forward to reading your questions and comments.

[Editor's Note: The full Patch Notes for Update 2.4.0 will also be published soon, during scheduled maintenance and deployment.]

Destiny Weapon Tuning - June Update
Destiny Update 2.3.0 is scheduled to deploy tomorrow. The following is a preview of how it will impact weapon balance.

From the desk of Greg Peng:

Hi everyone! Sandbox Designer Greg Peng here. Pleased to meet you. I've been working with Jon Weisnewski on weapons since The Taken King (he's my boss), and I'll be your gunsmith for the upcoming Rise of Iron. I am honored for this opportunity to step up as another representative for Sandbox.

For 2.3.0, our primary goal has been to address some of the most commonly voiced concerns from the Destiny community, and to continue to bring balance and improvements to our little piece of the Destiny universe.

Weapon Balance
Hand Cannons
After a shot has been fired from a weapon in Destiny, there is a short period where accuracy drops to simulate how weapon recoil affects re-acquiring a target. This helps dissuade players from spamming the trigger and emphasizes precise aiming. The degree of accuracy drop is controlled by the Range stat per archetype. Because of the increased importance of landing every shot, this effect is especially heightened on Hand Cannons.

It is our intention to reduce the necessity of rolling range perks on Hand Cannons in order for them to be considered usable. However, we also do not want to return to a world where Hand Cannons can contest Scout Rifles at long range. 

Changes

Increased initial accuracy and decreased accuracy drop for low range hand cannons
Made damage falloff curves steeper to better coincide with intended effective range of hand cannons
Small increase to PvE damage to all hand cannons (amount depending on enemy class)
Auto Rifles
Doctrine of Passing. Soulstealer's Claw. Arminus-D. These names strike fear into opponent's hearts, not only due to their quick kill times, but also the amount of screen shake or "ping" they inflict upon their targets. The family of high rate of fire auto rifles currently leads the pack as most used, and so we will nudge it lower once again.

Changes 

Reduced the damage of high rate of fire autos (Doctrine of Passing) by 6%
Ammo Economy
Running out of ammo? The recommended solution is to grab some fresh ammo that just dropped at the feet of a dead combatant. But we recognize that there are certain dire combat scenarios where gathering blocks is not a viable solution. In these cases, we currently detect that you're low on ammo, round up ammo from the field, and automatically deposit it in your backpack. As an improvement, we've significantly sped up the time this process takes. 

Changes

It takes less time to automatically grab ammo from the battlefield for you when you're running low.
Hawkmoon
With the recent Hand Cannon improvements, the Hawk was flying a bit too high. A minor stability reduction brings it into line, but may encourage a reexamination of one's barrel selection...

Changes

Slight reduction to Hawkmoon Stability (-5 Stability)
Counterbalance
There are some cases where a perk's effectiveness makes it seem like an absolute necessity to run. For many players this is currently true for Counterbalance; not only is it an extremely effective perk, but it nullifies the uniqueness of each gun's recoil pattern. We hope these changes will let the personality of each gun shine through a bit more.

Changes

Slight reduction to Counterbalance effectiveness (Reduces 80% of recoil angle instead of 90%)
Bugs
Fixed incorrect UI bars on Red Spectre (no gameplay changes)
Fixed Exotic Machine Gun Stability where some weapons were ignoring their own base stats for recoil (Thunderlord, Super Good Advice)
Fixed Defiance of Yasmin to have the correctly adjusted zoom for Sniper Rifles introduced in 2.2.0 (5x), increased inventory stat by 10 to compensate
Sandbox Mythbusters
I'm hoping to also use this opportunity to clear up some common questions and misconceptions for how weapons in Destiny work. Knowledge is power!

What does Rangefinder REALLY do?
According to the description on the Perk: "Aiming this weapon increases its effective range."

There are a couple ways to interpret this description. A common interpretation is that the Rangefinder increases the Range stat when a player goes into aim down sights (ADS). In reality, it is a bit more nuanced than a simple sentence can encompass.

Rangefinder impacts two primary things:

Target acquisition falloff
Zoom factor multiplier (1.1x zoom, 1.05x on shotguns)
So why do we call it "Rangefinder?" Well, Zoom itself is a huge component of damage falloff! We scale down damage falloff by the Zoom factor because enemies FEEL closer in zoom view, even though they can be quite far away. This is super important to keeping things feeling consistent.

What's more, ADS accuracy and recoil are also calculated based on the zoom view. So with greater zoom, your bullets will also stay closer together, which is another element of extending the effective range of your weapon. Everything is relative!

What is Weapon Handling?
While we don't display it in the UI like we do the other weapon stats, Weapon Handling is a stat that controls three things to make your gun feel heavier or snappier in your hands:

Ready time - amount of time it takes to bring  out your weapon
Away time - amount of time it takes to put away your weapon
ADS time - amount of time it takes to fully reach maximum zoom in ADS
Different guns have different Weapon Handling stats, but as a general rule of thumb, the longer range and more damage a weapon does, the lower the Weapon Handling stat.

That's all for the 2.3.0 Weapons Update Preview. I hope it's been informative, and I'm looking forward to hearing your questions and comments.

Destiny Weapon Tuning - April Update
From the desk of Senior Designer Jon Weisnewski:

Greetings internet friends! Did we miss each other? I hope so. We're back once more to talk about weapon and gameplay tuning that is headed to Destiny once the April update goes live. Designer Greg Peng and I have been working hard turning knobs, digesting data, playtesting, and then playtesting some more. As with all of these updates, I imagine some of these changes will be anticipated... and some not. I'm sure you'll discuss this at length. Shaxx and I will be waiting for you in the Crucible on April 12.

BASE WEAPON CHANGES
AUTO RIFLES
High Rate-of-Fire (RoF) bullet hoses have been leading the pack in terms of competitive viability. Low RoF auto rifles are slightly behind their faster firing brethren. We're tipping the scales ever so slightly on these weapons to try and create more options.

Goals:

Auto Rifle is optimal at close to medium range
Legendary low RoF Auto Rifles are a viable competitive choice
High Rate of Fire auto rifles are viable but not best in class
Changes:

Low RoF (Suros Regime, An Answering Chord, Anguish of Drystan): 2.3% increase in base damage
High RoF (Doctrine of Passing, Arminius-D): 2.5% reduction in base damage
Improvement to hip fire final accuracy
PULSE RIFLES
As with the auto rifles, the lowest RoF pulse rifles aren't quite as effective as the faster firing models. The damage increase here doesn't reduce bursts to kill against high Armor players in PVP, but it will provide more damage per burst which will help when team shooting and getting clean up kills.

Goals:

Pulse Rifle is optimal at medium range, but can still effectively engage enemies at close or medium-long range
Legendary low RoF pulse rifles are a viable competitive choice
Changes:

Low RoF (The Messenger, Spare Change, Lyudmila-D): 3% increase from previous base damage
HAND CANNONS
Hand Cannons were running lean on ammo inventory during PVP streaks and lengthy PVE encounters. We are increasing their ammo inventory amounts by a bit to not leave you scrounging for white bricks too often, but not so much that you don't need to worry about making shots count.

Goals:

Hand Cannons are optimal at close to medium range
Rewards agility under fire, precision targeting, and snap shots
Hand Cannons have enough ammo to last longer streaks in all activities
Changes:

Increase ammo inventory for all Hand Cannons
FUSION RIFLES
The changes made in the last patch were somewhat more in depth than a blanket stability reduction: changing the ADS/Hip bolt spread paradigm as well as charge rate/damage tradeoffs. Rather than continue to play with nuance, this time we're just going to do a blanket stability improvement.

Goals:

Fusion Rifles are optimal at mid-range, where targets are easier to track but they're not close enough to attack while charging up
Require combat foresight and the ability to predict a target's movement to use successfully
Low Stability does not make Fusion Rifles overly difficult to use.
Changes:

Fusion rifles are more stable across the board. The maximum stability for a fusion rifle has not changed much, but the baseline minimum stability is much stronger (40% recoil reduction), and we linearly ramp up from there.
Fixed bug where some outlying fusion rifle scopes had unintended increased zoom that was removed in Year Two. 
SNIPER RIFLES
The intent for Sniper Rifles has always been lethality at a distance using a measured approach. There are a few scopes and models of Sniper Rifles that are pushing the limits of "distance" and allowing for pretty effective twitch combat shooting at what many would consider medium range. These changes aren't intended to remove that style of combat, but they are intended to put the player at slightly longer ranges for that style to be as effective as it is currently.

Goals:

Sniper Rifles are optimal at long range, and difficult to use for medium to short range combat
Sniper Rifles reward thumb skill with high damage against precision targets
Changes:

Increase base zoom distance on the lowest range sniper scopes. Medium to long range scopes are untouched
Increase base zoom distance on Sniper Rifles that did not have Optics enhancing scope nodes: Hereafter, Black Spindle, Patience & Time, Stillpiercer
Add 2 frames of zoom time to base Sniper handling
Reduce Snapshot perk to 20% benefit to base zoom time (down from 30%)
Reduce Stability across all Sniper Rifle stats so that reacquiring a target after firing requires more care
Addressed a bug where Zen Moment was not providing perk benefit to Sniper Rifles
Zen Moment removed from uncommon and rare sniper grids
Legendary Hakke Sniper Rifles trade Zen Moment for Performance Bonus
Legendary Omolon Sniper Rifles trade Zen Moment for Battle Runner
AMMO ECONOMY
We've heard pretty consistent feedback about the prevalence of special and heavy ammo in The Crucible. Data shows an uptick in Special weapon time equipped starting around December.



A while ago, the PVP design team made some changes to ammo spawns in 3v3 gametypes, and they'll have some more changes to PVP ammo in 2.2.0. In addition to game mode ammo rules, we want to put some limits on how much ammo players get and horde during a PVP match.

Goals:

Special and Heavy ammo is a valued commodity over the course of a Crucible match
Players should be mindful of ammo conservation
The choice to use a Special weapon should be based on recognizing a strategic opportunity
Using Ice Breaker or Sidearms to "charge up" your ammo reserves for other weapons is not intended
Changes:

Swapping special weapons in PVP now completely removes special ammo until more is found on the map
Reduce the total Ammo Inventory for all Sniper Rifles by roughly 5-7 rounds (exact amount depends on a given weapon's Magazine and Inventory stats)
Reduce the total Ammo Inventory for all Shotguns by roughly 5-7 rounds (exact amount depends on a given weapon's Magazine and Inventory stats)
Increase Special Ammo drop rate in all PVE activities to offset the reduced Inventory for Shotguns and Sniper Rifles
Reduce the fraction of ammo granted by purple bricks in PVP. This change affects all Machineguns and only a handful of Rocket Launchers (Truth is one of the affected Rocket Launchers).
Reduced bonus Ammo Inventory granted by Machinegun Ammo Armor Perk by 33%
PLAYER RESURRECTION
Ally resurrection is a huge strategic factor in high intensity PVP and PVE. In the safety of cover or during a lull in combat it is an obvious helping hand to extend to your dead buddy. However, when an ally meets their end smack in the middle of a frantic firefight it should be with great peril that one risks their safety to bring them back. There are a number of elements in place that help players assess the risk/reward of sticking their neck out to revive a friend: time to resurrect, interactive prompt distance to Ghost, and resurrection overshield.

Right now these elements can be used in a variety of ways (and in combination with exotic armor) to greatly reduce the risk of bringing back a downed Fireteam member in the heat of combat. The downstream result of that starts to trend towards a trivialized death penalty and recklessness during the activities that have been built to require precision gameplay. 

Goals:

Resurrecting a player in the heat of combat should require the reviving player to put themselves at risk
Revive sniping in PVP should not be limited to a handful of Sniper Rifles
Changes:

Reduce interactive radius of resurrection prompt by .5 meters
Increase base time to resurrect by .25 seconds
Re-prioritize Overshield so that it takes precision damage modifiers (previously it did not) which allows more Sniper archetypes to get res-kills
Only a few PvE combatants deal precision damage so aside from a few exceptions this only affects the PVP mechanic
Adjust resurrection invincibility frames so that the moment a player can move and take damage are more consistent in most networking conditions
Reduce resurrection time bonus on exotic armor (Crest of Alpha Lupi, Light Beyond Nemesis) to 30% (down from 40%)
WEAPON PERKS
Eye of the Storm

Perk now improves error angle in addition to projectile accuracy so players can see the hip reticle contract as the perk activates
Icarus

Airborne inaccuracy reduced by an additional +9% (was 66% reduction, now 75% reduction)
Aggressive Ballistics
Aggressive Ballistics is a barrel perk that adds the highest damage increase to the weapon when selected, and can also roll on a handful of exotic and legendary primary weapons. This perk in particular has made balancing a few archetypes very tricky - bringing up the base damage to a certain threshold will make these weapons with Aggressive Ballistics abnormally lethal for that archetype. This change affects Aggressive Ballistics on all weapons.

Changes:
Damage increase now asks for a -20 stability trade off (from -10)
EXOTIC & LEGENDARY WEAPON TUNING
MIDA Multi Tool
Holy ****!! 



Ignoring popularity, we think MIDA is fairly balanced in the global scale of weapons but I'm sure many non-MIDA users are starting to get tired of seeing that name come up in their death screen. Considering the popularity of the weapon we wanted to preserve how it feels to use but thought it was best to make it a little less horrible to be on the receiving end.

Changes
Remove high caliber rounds from the intrinsic behavior
SUROS Regime

Since we added the Spinning Up perk to this weapon, it has become the dominant playstyle for Suros users. The base damage increase of this archetype made Spinning Up pretty deadly, so we pushed out the perk activation by 4 shots. We are hoping to make the Focus Fire option a little more enticing by adding a base Range increase on the node. When selecting Focus Fire along with other Range enhancements on the grid players can now push the weapon to a max Range stat.

Changes
Selecting Focus Fire grants +45 Range stat
Spinning Up now activates (4 shots) later in the magazine
Hawkmoon
Although Hawkmoon still has the highest damage to magazine ratio for Hand Cannons, the last round of changes left the weapon feeling inaccurate. It is getting a Range increase to help effective range and accuracy.

Changes
Increase base Range stat by 10
The Last Word
In 2.0 we reduced the effective range of The Last Word, but the hip fire accuracy and damage increase provided by The Last Word perk are still pretty strong when working together on this weapon. For the players who have mastered hip fire precision shooting, this weapon can cause 2 hit precision kills which is a very fast kill time on a full auto weapon. To keep the time to kill in line with other exotic primaries, we are removing the damage increase granted from hip fire. The Last Word perk still grants generous Stability and Accuracy when firing from hip.

Changes
No damage bonus is applied from The Last Word perk
Thorn
Thorn is back and better than ever! (Just kidding!) This pass on Thorn maintains the power fantasy of using the weapon in all activities, but makes it significantly less difficult to fight against in PvP.

Changes
Reduce Damage Over Time (DoT) tick damage to the absolute minimum in PvP (1 HP base damage)
Reduce DoT duration in PvP to 4 ticks (down from 6)
Reduce intensity of poison screen effects for the victim to preserve combat effectiveness while poisoned
Ice Breaker
Like Thorn, even though this weapon is "on the bench" in terms of current power level, many people are using it to great advantage to work around ammo restrictions. This is predominantly occurring in high-skill PvP matches, so these changes are targeted at that skill level: aggressive snipers using Ice Breaker for medium range quick sniping will be more affected. For casual players, these changes are targeted at reinforcing Ice Breaker's intended role as a slow paced, long distance combat tool.

Changes
Increase scope zoom Optics to 6x
Reduce base Handling stat to the lowest value for Sniper Rifles
Reduce base Target Acquisition by 25%
"Death swapping" in PVP no longer allows ammo to persist between swapped weapons
Dreg's Promise
When it was released in House of Wolves it was one of two total Sidearms in the game. In the current range of Sidearm options, Dreg's Promise is rarely used so we wanted to give it some attention.

Changes
Projectiles track more aggressively: On fire, targeting locks onto the enemy in your reticle. Damage reduced (40%) and rate of fire reduced to compensate
Damage falloff reduced to match Sidearm archetype range
Lord of Wolves

Changes
Reduce ammo inventory to reflect base Shotgun inventory reduction
Queenbreaker's Bow

Changes
Reduce ammo inventory to reflect base Sniper inventory reduction
Telesto

Changes
Fixed bug that caused Telesto projectiles to despawn when impacting friendly players and Wards of Dawn. Telesto rounds now attach and detonate on friendly targets but do not cause friendly fire.
The Chaperone

Changes
Fixed a bug that was clamping precision damage on shotguns
1000 Yard Stare
This weapon has one of the highest adoption rates for any gun we've ever released. I think there are a number of factors that contribute to this, but the end result is a pretty remarkable spike in weapon usage.

  

This is an interesting situation. We don't like punishing a relatively-balanced weapon just because it is popular, but we also want players to feel like they have options. For now, the safest way to reduce this spike is to preserve the feeling of the weapon, preserve the talent grid rolls that many players are no doubt happy with, and just pull a few rounds out of the Inventory.

Changes
Reduce base Ammo Inventory stat
Quillims Terminus
The Raid Machinegun is one of the most lethal and ammo-rich heavies in the game. As such, it has become the default choice for most people who have it. Data!



Not to keep banging the same drum, but it is important to us that players feel like they have options and that there isn't a single ultimate weapon per archetype.

Changes
Reduce base Stability stat by 9
Reduce base Inventory stat by 15
King's Fall Weapon Set

Anguish of Drystan
Increase Stability stat by 12%
All King's Fall primaries
Increased reload speed

Year One Perks
We have revisted all of these Year One stat perks and reduced the amount they buff your weapon stat to re-normalize against Year Two weapon lethality and reinforce specialization so players are making meaningful trade-offs on weapons.

To compensate for the weaker stat perks from launch weapons, we added some new stat perks (introduced in House of Wolves) that provided a significant increase to a stat in exchange for a reduction in other stats.

Update 1.0.2 - Patch Notes
Summary:
With this patch, we address some widely-discussed concerns with how Engrams are earned and claimed. Strikes have become more rewarding, and the rewards gained from them are more predictable. Also affected is the rotation of maps that appear in the Crucible.

Cryptarch
Legendary (purple) engrams will always produce a Legendary quality item or higher
Note: Legendary engrams that exist in your inventory will change to Rare quality items when the patch is applied. However, decoding these engrams will still produce the same results as before
Rare (blue) engrams will always produce a Rare quality item or higher
Chance for Legendary gear increased
Materials: Ascendant Shards and Ascendant Energy promoted to Legendary quality (from Rare quality)
Rewards
Rare (Blue) and Legendary (Purple) Engram drops added to the potential rewards for:
Vanguard: Tiger Strike Playlist
Daily Heroic Missions (first time per day)
Weekly Heroic Missions (first time per week)
Known issues
When selecting a higher difficulty for daily missions, XP Bonus not show in the reward display
You will still get the XP bonus, you just won't see it in the UI
Crucible
Reduced time limit on Bastion and First Light in Control and Clash from 15 to 12 minutes, bringing them in line with non-vehicle maps in those playlists
Lowered weighting on Bastion and First Light in Control and Clash so they appear less often in those playlists


1.0.2 Patch Preview
The 1.0.2 patch will go live next week, and includes several changes to the Cryptarch and Engram experience. These changes guarantee that Engrams will always decode into items at or above the quality of an engram.

Only Engrams that drop after 1.0.2 are subject to this change.

Cryptarch Changes
Cayde-6 took the Cryptarch aside and showed him a sack of doorknobs. He decoded that mystery pretty quickly.

Legendary Engrams will always produce Legendary or better quality items, including Materials or Exotics
Rare Engrams will always produce Rare or better quality items
Rare engrams will have an increased chance to produce Legendary quality items
Activity Changes
Daily Heroics, Weekly Heroics, and Vanguard: Tiger Playlist activities will include Rare and Legendary Engrams in addition to their existing rewards
Item Changes
Ascendant materials have been promoted to Legendary to closer associate them with the gear they are used to upgrade
Legendary Engram items that exist in your inventory will be demoted to Rare quality when the patch goes live, so decode them while you can. But let's be honest--even if you don't, we all know they were blues already...


Hot Fix - 09/25/2014

Hot Fix - 09/14/2014
Not every update that you apply to Destiny will contain revolutionary changes to the player experience. As we support the world of Destiny beyond the launch, much of what we do behind the scenes will be dedicated to ensuring the services that support the game are stable.

Yesterday, we deployed an update that delivered the following refinements.

Engineering
Fixes for Xbox One bootflow issues
Changes in network configuration to improve stability
Fixes for issues causing game crashes
Events
Public Events should occur twice as frequently in public spaces
As we continue to support the Destiny Community, please keep talking to us about any issues you encounter on our Help forum.



Update 1.0.1 - Patch Notes
We used to build games that were pressed on discs, shipped to retailers, bought by consumers and then, in the months and years that followed, we'd support them the best we could. We updated playlists, made tuning changes, and developed new multiplayer maps.

With Destiny, we couldn't create a world that players want to live in by leveraging our old habits. We want to improve, grow and evolve Destiny in the coming weeks, months and - hopefully - years.

The hours you poured into the beta were instructive, the feedback you provided was heard, and the time you've spent with us so far is humbling.

Patch 1.0.1 won't be the last changes to Destiny. Our goal is to constantly improve the Live game. The game we hope is competing for your free time.

Work is already underway on upcoming patches. Some will contain new content, some will contain the next round of improvements, and some will undoubtedly react to issues that you - the playerbase - will uncover in the coming weeks.
We're just getting started.
