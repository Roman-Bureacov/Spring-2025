# Spring-2025
Repository for code written for UWT Winter 2025 classes

If you stumble across this trying to look for code for your own classes, 
I implore you to try to think about your code first before attempting to look for solutions.

The art of programming and software development is making it yourself. What's the point 
of painting if you don't pick up the brush.

That isn't to say you should avoid examples of existing work, but be careful of being too
dependent on examples and try learning from them than to use them as templates.
